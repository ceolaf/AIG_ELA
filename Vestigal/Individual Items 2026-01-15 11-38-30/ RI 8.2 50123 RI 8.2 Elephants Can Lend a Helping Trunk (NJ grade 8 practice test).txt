2. How does the author most effectively develop the central idea that elephants have advanced cooperative understanding?

A. By beginning with expert opinions about elephant intelligence, then briefly mentioning an experiment without explaining its results.  
B. By stating that elephants can recognize when they need help, then describing step-by-step experiments that test this ability, and finally using expert commentary and real-world examples to confirm the findings.*  
C. By focusing mainly on how mahouts train elephants in Thailand and using the cooperation experiment only as background.  
D. By arguing that elephants are more intelligent than all other animals and using the rope experiment to prove that they are superior.

**Correct Answer: B***

### Rationales

**Option B (Correct):**  
- The central idea is that elephants have sophisticated social cognition, including the ability to recognize when they need a partner’s help and to act on that understanding.  
- In the first paragraph, the author clearly states this idea: elephants “know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk” and belong to an “elite club of social cooperators.”  
- The next two paragraphs develop this idea by describing the rope-and-table experiments in detail: first, elephants learn to pull together; then, they learn to wait for a partner and to give up when the partner’s rope is out of reach. These step-by-step results support and clarify the central idea.  
- The final paragraph brings in scientists’ comments and natural observations (like elephants lifting a fallen companion), which connect the experiment to broader evidence and confirm that these cooperative abilities are real and impressive.  
- This answer correctly explains both what the central idea is and how it is developed through experiments and supporting ideas.

**Option A (Distractor):**  
- The article does include expert opinions, but they come mainly at the end, after the experiments are described, not at the beginning.  
- The experiments are not “briefly mentioned”; they are described in detail, including how the setup works and how elephants behave in different conditions.  
- This option reverses the actual structure and underplays the central role of the experimental evidence in developing the main idea.

**Option C (Distractor):**  
- Mahouts and the Thai Elephant Conservation Center are mentioned only to explain the setting and who worked with the elephants; they are not the main focus.  
- The cooperation experiment is not background—it is the core of the article’s evidence for the central idea.  
- A student choosing this might focus on the setting details instead of recognizing that the text’s main development centers on the experimental design and results.

**Option D (Distractor):**  
- The author does not claim that elephants are more intelligent than all other animals. Instead, elephants are said to “join an elite club” with chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.  
- The rope experiment is used to show that elephants understand when they need a partner, not to argue that they are superior overall.  
- This option misstates both the central idea (cooperative understanding, not general superiority) and how the supporting experiment is used.

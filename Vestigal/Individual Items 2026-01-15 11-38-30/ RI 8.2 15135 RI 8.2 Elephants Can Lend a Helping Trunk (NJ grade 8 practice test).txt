Based on the passage "Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk," here is a multiple choice item aligned to RI.8.2:

**Which statement best describes how the central idea about elephants' cooperative abilities develops throughout the text?**

A. The text begins by claiming elephants have advanced social cognition, then provides experimental evidence showing they can work together, and concludes by comparing their abilities favorably to other intelligent species.

*B. The text introduces the concept that elephants understand when they need help, develops this through increasingly complex experimental scenarios that test different aspects of cooperation, and reinforces it with expert validation and natural observations.

C. The text starts with a broad comparison of elephants to other animals, narrows to focus on one specific experiment, then expands again to discuss implications for understanding animal intelligence in general.

D. The text presents the hypothesis that elephants can cooperate, challenges this idea by showing the difficulties in the experiments, then resolves the tension by explaining how elephants eventually learned the tasks.

**Rationales:**

**Option A:** While this option captures some elements of the text's structure, it misses the crucial development of HOW the experiments progressively demonstrated different aspects of cooperative understanding. The text doesn't just show elephants "can work together" but specifically develops the idea that they understand the need for a partner.

**Option B (Correct):** This accurately captures the text's development. The opening establishes the central claim about recognizing the need for help. The middle sections develop this through three distinct experimental phases: basic cooperation training, waiting for partners (showing understanding of timing), and recognizing when cooperation is impossible (showing understanding of necessity). The conclusion reinforces this with expert opinions and real-world examples.

**Option C:** This mischaracterizes the text's structure. While the text does mention other animals, it doesn't start with a broad comparison. The focus remains consistently on elephant cooperation throughout, with other species mentioned only as context.

**Option D:** This suggests a problem-solution structure that doesn't exist in the text. The experiments don't show elephants struggling and then succeeding; rather, they show elephants successfully demonstrating increasingly sophisticated understanding of cooperation from the start.

1. Which statement best explains how a central idea of the article develops across the text?

A. The article begins by arguing that elephants are more intelligent than all other animals and then proves this by showing they can solve any problem scientists give them.  

B. The article introduces the idea that elephants have advanced social cooperation, then explains experiments that test this ability, and finally connects the results to similar findings and real-world elephant behavior.*  

C. The article introduces the idea that elephants are in danger, then describes how scientists study them, and ends by suggesting that better cooperation could help protect the species.  

D. The article begins by explaining the history of elephant training, then shows how trainers teach elephants tricks, and ends by questioning whether elephants truly understand what they are doing.  

**Correct Answer: B***

### Rationales

**Option B (Key):**  
- The central idea is that elephants show advanced social cooperation and social cognition.  
- Paragraph 1 introduces this idea directly, stating elephants recognize when they need help and placing them in an “elite club of social cooperators.”  
- Paragraphs 2–3 describe and layer the rope-pulling experiments that test and reveal this cooperative understanding (waiting for partners, giving up when help is impossible).  
- The final paragraph connects these experimental results to observations in the wild (e.g., lifting a fallen companion) and to other research on animal cognition, reinforcing and broadening the central idea.  
- This option accurately traces how that central idea is introduced, supported by experiments, and then strengthened through expert commentary and real-world examples.

**Option A (Distractor):**  
- Misstates the central idea: the article does not claim elephants are “more intelligent than all other animals” or that they can solve “any problem.”  
- Misrepresents the development: the text compares elephants to other species and shows specific cooperative tasks, not “any” task.  
- A student choosing this likely overgeneralizes from the mention of an “elite club” and the impressive results, without carefully tracking what the article actually claims and supports.

**Option C (Distractor):**  
- Introduces a different, unsupported central idea: the article does not focus on elephants being “in danger” or on conservation.  
- The text never suggests that “better cooperation could help protect the species.”  
- This reflects a misunderstanding of the article’s purpose (scientific study of cognition and cooperation) and confuses it with common themes in other elephant-related texts.

**Option D (Distractor):**  
- Shifts the focus to “the history of elephant training” and “tricks,” which is not the article’s main line of development.  
- Mahouts and training are mentioned only briefly as context for how the experiment was run, not as the central idea.  
- The article never questions whether elephants “truly understand what they are doing”; instead, it argues that they do understand their need for a partner.  
- A student choosing this would be focusing on a minor detail (trainers) rather than the central idea and its development through the experiments and expert commentary.

1. Which statement best expresses a central idea of the article and explains how it is developed throughout the text?

A. The study proves that elephants are better than chimpanzees at every kind of problem-solving task, and this idea is developed by comparing elephants to chimpanzees in many different experiments.  
B.* Elephants show advanced social cooperation and understanding that they sometimes need help, and this idea is developed through descriptions of controlled experiments and comparisons to other intelligent animals.  
C. Mahouts play the most important role in elephant research, and this idea is developed by explaining how mahouts train elephants and prepare them for scientific studies.  
D. Wild elephants behave very differently from captive elephants, and this idea is developed by contrasting observations of wild elephants with the behavior of elephants in the study.

Rationales:

**A.**  
- Misstates the article’s main idea and its development.  
- The text does not claim elephants are better than chimpanzees “at every kind of problem-solving task”; it only notes they learned one cooperative task faster and waited longer.  
- Comparisons to chimpanzees appear, but they are limited and not the main structure used to develop the central idea.

**B.* (Correct)**  
- Accurately identifies a central idea: elephants possess sophisticated social cognition, including recognizing when they need a partner’s help.  
- This idea is developed by:  
  - Explaining the cooperative rope-pulling experiment and how it was modified for elephants.  
  - Showing how elephants waited for partners and gave up when a partner could not help, indicating understanding of cooperation.  
  - Comparing elephants’ performance to chimpanzees and rooks and placing elephants in an “elite club of social cooperators.”  
  - Including expert commentary that the findings match observations of elephants helping one another in the wild.  
- This option correctly describes both the central idea and how supporting details build it over the course of the text.

**C.**  
- Focuses on mahouts, who are mentioned only briefly as trainers helping prepare the elephants.  
- The article does not develop the idea that mahouts are “the most important role” in research; their role is supporting, not central.  
- There is no extended explanation of training methods or a through-line about mahouts, so this does not match how the text is structured.

**D.**  
- Suggests a central idea about differences between wild and captive elephants that the article does not develop.  
- Wild elephant behavior is mentioned only briefly as supporting evidence (elephants lifting a fallen companion) to reinforce the central idea about cooperation.  
- The text does not systematically contrast wild and captive elephants, so this does not accurately represent the main idea or its development.

2. Which statement best describes a central idea of the article and how the author develops it?

A. The article argues that elephants are naturally kind animals and develops this idea by describing how they help each other in the wild and by sharing emotional stories from elephant trainers.  

B. The article claims that elephants can be easily trained and develops this idea by explaining the role of mahouts and showing how quickly elephants learn to pull the rope for food.  

C. The article presents the idea that elephants have advanced social understanding and cooperation, then develops this idea through descriptions of controlled experiments and expert commentary that connect the results to other animal studies and wild elephant behavior.*  

D. The article suggests that elephants are more intelligent than chimpanzees and develops this idea by comparing their brain sizes and listing tasks in which elephants always outperform chimpanzees.  

**Correct Answer: C***

### Rationales

**Option C (Key):**  
- Central idea: Elephants show advanced social understanding and cooperation (a form of higher social cognition).  
  - Introduced in paragraph 1: elephants know when they need help; they join an “elite club of social cooperators.”  
- Development:  
  - Paragraphs 2–3 describe the rope-pulling experiments and the changes in conditions (different release times, unreachable partner rope) that reveal elephants understand when a partner is needed.  
  - The final paragraph brings in experts who compare these results to chimpanzees and rooks and to observations of elephants helping each other in the wild.  
- This option captures both the central idea and the way it is developed: through experiments, comparisons to other species, and real-world examples.

**Option A (Distractor):**  
- Misidentifies the central idea: the focus is not on elephants being “naturally kind” or on emotional stories.  
- The article emphasizes cognition and cooperation, not kindness; it relies on scientific experiments and expert analysis, not emotional anecdotes from trainers.  
- Students choosing this may be over-reading the helping behavior as “kindness” instead of understanding the scientific focus on social cognition.

**Option B (Distractor):**  
- Shifts the central idea to trainability, which is not the main focus.  
- Mahouts and training are mentioned only briefly as background to how elephants learned the rope-pulling action, not as the core concept.  
- The article develops the idea of understanding cooperation, not “easy training.”  
- This reflects confusion between a supporting detail (training for the task) and the central idea (social cooperation and cognition).

**Option D (Distractor):**  
- Distorts the claim: the article does not say elephants are generally “more intelligent than chimpanzees,” nor does it compare brain sizes.  
- It notes that elephants learned to wait “faster than the chimpanzees” *in this specific task*, but that is one comparison, not a broad claim about overall intelligence.  
- The text also discusses rooks and hyenas, so it is not centered on an elephant–chimpanzee competition.  
- Students choosing this are overgeneralizing from a single comparison instead of tracking the broader central idea and its development.

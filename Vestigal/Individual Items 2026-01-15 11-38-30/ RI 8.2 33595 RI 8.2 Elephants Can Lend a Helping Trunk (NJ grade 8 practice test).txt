1. Which statement best expresses a central idea of the passage?

A. Elephants can be trained by humans to perform complex tricks for rewards.  
*B. Elephants show advanced social cognition by understanding when they need a partner’s help to succeed at a task.*  
C. Elephants are more intelligent than all other animals, including chimpanzees and rooks.  
D. Elephants in captivity behave very differently from elephants in the wild.

**Correct Answer: B***

**Rationales:**

**Option A:**  
- This is partially related to the passage (mahouts help train elephants to pull the rope), but training is not the main focus.  
- The article emphasizes what the experiments reveal about elephants’ *natural* cooperative thinking, not about teaching tricks.  
- A student choosing this may be focusing too narrowly on the training details rather than the broader purpose of the study.

**Option B (Correct):**  
- The passage repeatedly highlights that elephants:  
  - “know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk,”  
  - understand they “will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance,”  
  - wait for their partners and give up when a partner cannot help.  
- These points support the central idea that elephants have advanced social cognition and understand when cooperation is necessary.  
- The description of experiments, comparisons to chimpanzees and rooks, and comments from scientists all develop this idea across the text.

**Option C:**  
- The passage never claims elephants are more intelligent than *all* other animals.  
- It says elephants “join an elite club” of cooperators and compares them to chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans, noting some similarities and differences (e.g., waiting longer than chimps, rooks not waiting).  
- This option overgeneralizes and misrepresents the author’s more balanced comparison.

**Option D:**  
- The passage briefly mentions wild elephants (e.g., lifting a fallen companion) to support the study’s findings, but it does not argue that captive and wild elephants behave “very differently.”  
- Instead, it shows that behavior in the lab is consistent with behavior observed in nature.  
- A student choosing this may be confusing a supporting example (wild observations) with the central idea of the text.

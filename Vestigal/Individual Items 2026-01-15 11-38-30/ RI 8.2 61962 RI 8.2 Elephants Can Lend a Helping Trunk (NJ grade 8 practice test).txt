**Multiple Choice Item:**

Which statement best describes how the passage develops its central idea about elephants' social intelligence through supporting ideas?

A. The passage establishes elephants' cooperative abilities as exceptional, uses experimental evidence to demonstrate specific cognitive skills, and reinforces this through expert validation and real-world examples.*

B. The passage presents elephants as the most intelligent animals, describes a single experiment that proves this claim, and concludes that elephants surpass all other species in cooperation.

C. The passage introduces a hypothesis about elephant intelligence, tests it through observation of wild elephants, and then conducts laboratory experiments to confirm the observations.

D. The passage begins with examples of elephant cooperation in nature, questions whether this indicates true understanding, and uses experiments to show elephants merely imitate other animals.

**Rationales:**

**Option A (Correct):** This accurately captures the development of the central idea and its relationship to supporting ideas:
- The passage establishes the central idea in paragraph 1 (elephants understand when they need help, showing "higher social cognition")
- Supporting ideas include the detailed experimental evidence in paragraphs 2-3 (rope-pulling tests with increasing complexity)
- Further support comes from expert commentary (McComb and Clayton in paragraph 4) and real-world validation (wild elephants helping fallen companions)

**Option B (Incorrect):** The passage doesn't claim elephants are "the most intelligent animals" or that they surpass all other species. It actually places them alongside other capable species in an "elite club" that includes chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans. Additionally, multiple experiments are described, not just one.

**Option C (Incorrect):** This reverses the actual sequence. The passage begins with laboratory experiments (paragraphs 1-3) and then connects these findings to observations in nature (paragraph 4), not the other way around. The hypothesis is tested through controlled experiments first, then validated through natural observations.

**Option D (Incorrect):** The passage doesn't begin with natural examples—it starts with the experimental findings. It also doesn't question whether cooperation indicates understanding; instead, it affirms that specific behaviors (like giving up when a partner can't help) demonstrate genuine comprehension. There's no suggestion that elephants merely imitate other animals.

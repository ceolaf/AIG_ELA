Item (RI.8.2 – central idea and its development)

Which statement best explains how a central idea of the passage is developed throughout the text?

A. The passage develops the idea that elephants are more trainable than other animals by describing how mahouts teach them to pull ropes and follow commands.  

B. The passage develops the idea that elephants possess advanced social cooperation by explaining a rope‑pulling experiment, showing how elephants adapt to harder versions of the task, and connecting these results to similar behaviors in the wild.*  

C. The passage develops the idea that elephants are motivated mainly by food rewards by repeatedly describing the bowls of corn and how elephants behave to obtain them.  

D. The passage develops the idea that elephants are part of a rare “elite club” of animals by listing other species in the club and explaining how those species were tested in detail.  


Key: B*

Rationales

A. This is incorrect because it mistakes a supporting detail for a central idea and misreads how that detail functions. The mention of mahouts training elephants to pull ropes is included to set up the cooperation experiment, not to prove that elephants are “more trainable than other animals.” The passage does not compare levels of trainability across species, nor does it track that idea over the course of the text.

B. This is correct because it identifies a central idea and accurately describes how it is developed. A central idea is that elephants have advanced social cooperation and higher social cognition.  
- The introduction states that elephants “know when they need a helping hand” and that this ability is “a sign of higher social cognition.”  
- The middle paragraphs explain the rope‑pulling experiment and then “up the challenge” by releasing elephants at different times and moving the partner’s rope out of reach, showing elephants understand when a partner is needed.  
- The final paragraph connects these lab findings to observations in the wild (elephants lifting a fallen companion) and to other research on cognition, reinforcing and extending the idea that elephants show impressive cooperative abilities.  
This answer correctly captures both the central idea and how it is developed through experiments, results, and expert commentary.

C. This is incorrect because it elevates a minor, instrumental detail into a supposed central idea. The bowls of corn and food rewards are simply tools to motivate the animals in the experiment; they are not the focus of the article. The text does not analyze elephants’ “motivation” as its main point. The development described here does not match the actual structure or emphasis of the passage.

D. This is incorrect because it mischaracterizes how the “elite club” idea functions in the passage. The mention of chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans serves as context to show that elephants belong among species known for social cooperation, but the passage does not develop this as its main idea. It does not give detailed explanations of how all the other species were tested; instead, it briefly notes related studies. Thus, this option overstates the importance and development of that supporting idea.

## Multiple Choice Item for RI.8.2

**Stem:**
Which summary best captures the central idea of the passage and the key supporting evidence used to develop it?

**Answer Options:**

A. Asian elephants at a conservation center in Thailand learned to pull ropes to get corn rewards, demonstrating that elephants can be trained to perform tasks similar to those mastered by chimpanzees in the 1930s.

B. Elephants have proven they are among the most intelligent animals by joining humans, chimpanzees, hyenas, and rooks as the only species capable of working together to solve problems.

*C. Through experiments requiring coordinated rope-pulling, researchers demonstrated that elephants understand when cooperation is necessary, as shown by their ability to wait for partners and abandon tasks when cooperation is impossible.

D. Scientists studying elephant behavior have observed that wild elephants help fallen companions with their tusks, which led researchers to design rope-pulling experiments to test whether captive elephants would show similar helping behaviors.

**Rationales:**

**Option A (Distractor):** Students selecting this option are focusing on surface-level details about the experimental setup (location, rope-pulling, corn rewards) without grasping the deeper significance of what the experiments revealed. This summary misses the central finding about elephants' understanding of cooperation and treats the study as merely a training exercise.

**Option B (Distractor):** This option overgeneralizes the findings and misrepresents the central idea. While the text does mention that elephants joined an "elite club of social cooperators," the passage's main focus is specifically on elephants' ability to recognize when they need help, not on proving their general intelligence or ranking them among intelligent species.

**Option C (Key):** This is correct because it accurately summarizes both the central idea (elephants understand when cooperation is necessary) and the key supporting evidence (the rope-pulling experiments). The summary captures the two critical experimental findings that develop this idea: (1) elephants waited for partners when released at different times, and (2) they gave up when partners couldn't access their rope, demonstrating true understanding of the cooperative nature of the task.

**Option D (Distractor):** Students choosing this option have confused the sequence of information in the text. While the passage does mention wild elephants helping fallen companions, this is presented as supporting evidence near the end, not as the motivation for the study. This option also incorrectly suggests the experiments were designed to test "helping behaviors" rather than understanding of cooperation.

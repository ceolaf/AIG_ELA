1. Which statement best explains how a central idea of the article develops across the passage?

A. The article begins by arguing that elephants are more intelligent than all other animals and then shows how they use their intelligence to survive in the wild.  
B.* The article introduces the idea that elephants have advanced social cooperation and then develops this idea by describing experiments and expert observations that show elephants understand when they need a partner’s help.  
C. The article starts by explaining how mahouts train elephants and then proves that trained elephants can perform almost any task humans give them.  
D. The article presents the idea that elephants are in danger in the wild and then explains how studying their cooperation might help protect them.

**Rationales**

- **Option A (Incorrect):**  
  - Misstates the central idea: the article does not claim elephants are “more intelligent than all other animals.”  
  - The text focuses on one specific kind of intelligence—social cooperation—not on overall intelligence or “survival in the wild.”  
  - While wild behavior is mentioned, it is used to support the idea of cooperation, not to show general survival skills.

- **Option B (Correct)*:**  
  - Accurately identifies a central idea: elephants show advanced social cooperation and understand when they need a partner.  
  - Reflects the structure of the article:  
    - First paragraph: introduces the study’s conclusion and notes elephants join an “elite club of social cooperators.”  
    - Middle paragraphs: describe the rope-pulling experiments that require partners and show elephants waiting for or giving up without a usable partner.  
    - Final paragraph: brings in outside experts who connect these results to observations of elephants helping one another in nature.  
  - Shows how the central idea is developed through experimental evidence and expert commentary.

- **Option C (Incorrect):**  
  - Treats mahout training as the central focus, but training is only briefly described to set up the experiment, not as the main idea.  
  - The article does not claim elephants can perform “almost any task humans give them”; it focuses on a narrow cooperative task.  
  - This option confuses a supporting detail (mahouts and training) with the central idea.

- **Option D (Incorrect):**  
  - Introduces a conservation theme (“elephants are in danger in the wild”) that does not appear in the passage.  
  - The article does not discuss threats to elephants or how the research might help protect them.  
  - This answer adds ideas beyond the text and does not match the way the central idea is actually developed.

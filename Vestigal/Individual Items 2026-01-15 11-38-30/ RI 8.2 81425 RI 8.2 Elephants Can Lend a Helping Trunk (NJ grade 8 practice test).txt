**Item (RI.8.2 – Central Idea & Its Development)**  

Which statement best explains a central idea of the passage and how it is developed over the course of the text?

A. The passage’s central idea is that elephants can be easily trained, which is developed by describing how mahouts teach them to pull ropes and follow instructions during the experiments.  

B. The passage’s central idea is that elephants show advanced cooperative understanding, which is developed by explaining a series of rope‑pulling experiments and then connecting the results to other animal studies and observations in the wild.*  

C. The passage’s central idea is that chimpanzees are less patient than elephants, which is developed by comparing how quickly each species learned to wait for a partner before pulling the rope.  

D. The passage’s central idea is that scientists are always modifying old experiments, which is developed by showing how a classic chimpanzee test was changed for elephants and then suggesting that similar changes could be made for other animals.

**Correct Answer: B***

### Rationales  

**A. The passage’s central idea is that elephants can be easily trained, which is developed by describing how mahouts teach them to pull ropes and follow instructions during the experiments.**  
- This option focuses on a supporting detail, not the central idea.  
- The text mentions training (mahouts teaching elephants to pull ropes) only to set up the main experiments, not as the main point of the article.  
- It does not account for how the idea develops later through waiting behavior, failed trials, and comparisons to other species.  

**B. The passage’s central idea is that elephants show advanced cooperative understanding, which is developed by explaining a series of rope‑pulling experiments and then connecting the results to other animal studies and observations in the wild.*  
- This captures the primary idea: elephants possess high-level social cognition and understand when they need a partner’s help.  
- The idea develops as the author:  
  - Introduces the claim that elephants can recognize when they need help.  
  - Describes step-by-step experiments (simultaneous pulling, delayed release, out-of-reach rope) showing elephants’ understanding of cooperation.  
  - Then reinforces this idea with expert commentary and real-world examples (lifting a fallen elephant, comparisons to chimpanzees and rooks).  
- It correctly explains both the central idea and how supporting ideas and evidence across the passage build and extend that idea.  

**C. The passage’s central idea is that chimpanzees are less patient than elephants, which is developed by comparing how quickly each species learned to wait for a partner before pulling the rope.**  
- This takes one comparison detail and incorrectly promotes it to the central idea.  
- The mention that elephants “learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees” is used to support the claim about elephants’ cognition, not to make chimpanzees the focus.  
- The development described is too narrow and does not include the other experiments, expert quotes, or field observations that support the broader idea about elephants.  

**D. The passage’s central idea is that scientists are always modifying old experiments, which is developed by showing how a classic chimpanzee test was changed for elephants and then suggesting that similar changes could be made for other animals.**  
- The modification of a classic experiment is a structural detail about research methods, not the main focus of the article.  
- The text does show that scientists adapted a chimpanzee test for elephants, but it does not emphasize “always modifying” experiments or extend this idea to “other animals” as a main line of development.  
- This option misidentifies a background explanation as the central idea and ignores how the passage returns repeatedly to what the results reveal about elephants’ cooperative intelligence.

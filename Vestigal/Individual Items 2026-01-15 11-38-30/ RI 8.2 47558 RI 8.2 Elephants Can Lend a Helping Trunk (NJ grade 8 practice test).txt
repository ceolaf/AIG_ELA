2. How does the author most effectively show that elephants understand when cooperation is necessary?

A. By stating that elephants are part of an “elite club” of social cooperators and leaving the claim unsupported.  
B. By first describing the basic rope-pulling task and then adding more complex versions of the experiment, along with expert commentary, to show elephants recognize when a partner is needed.*  
C. By focusing mainly on how mahouts train elephants to pull ropes and then briefly mentioning wild behavior at the end.  
D. By listing several different animal species and comparing their habitats to that of elephants.

**Correct Answer: B***

### Rationales

**Option B (Key):**  
- The author begins with the basic cooperative rope-pulling task, showing elephants must pull together to get corn.  
- The study is then made more complex: elephants are released at different times, so one must wait for the other; later, one partner’s rope is placed out of reach, and the other elephant “just give[s] up.”  
- These escalating experimental conditions show elephants adjust their behavior based on whether cooperation is actually possible, which supports the idea that they understand when a partner is needed.  
- The final paragraph adds expert commentary and naturalistic examples (like elephants lifting a fallen companion), further reinforcing this idea.  
- This option accurately traces how the central idea (elephants’ understanding of cooperation) is developed through increasingly challenging tasks and outside expert support.

**Option A (Distractor):**  
- The “elite club” phrase appears early, but it is a claim, not the main method of development.  
- The article does not “leave the claim unsupported”; most of the passage is devoted to explaining experiments and expert reactions.  
- This option ignores the key role of the experiments and misrepresents how the idea is developed.

**Option C (Distractor):**  
- Mahout training is mentioned only briefly to explain how elephants learned the basic pulling action.  
- The focus of the article is not on training techniques, but on how elephants behave in different cooperative conditions once they know how to pull the rope.  
- Wild behavior is not “briefly mentioned at the end” as an afterthought; instead, it is used as additional evidence alongside the experiments, not as the main focus.

**Option D (Distractor):**  
- The passage does list other species (chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, humans), but it does not compare their habitats, and habitat is irrelevant to the central idea.  
- The comparisons are about performance on cooperative tasks and waiting behavior, not where they live.  
- This choice misidentifies both the supporting ideas and the way the central idea is developed.

2. Which choice best states a central idea of the article and explains how the author develops it?

A. Elephants can be easily trained by humans, and the author develops this idea by describing how mahouts teach elephants to pull ropes for food rewards.  

B. Elephants are among the few animals that show advanced cooperative understanding, and the author develops this idea by presenting experimental results and expert commentary that compare elephants to other species.*  

C. Elephants are powerful animals that can move heavy objects, and the author develops this idea by describing how they pull tables of corn and lift fallen companions in the wild.  

D. Elephants are more patient than chimpanzees, and the author develops this idea by focusing on how long elephants can wait before pulling the rope in the experiment.  


**Rationales**

- **Option A (Incorrect):**  
  - Misidentifies the central idea: training by humans is a setup detail, not the main focus.  
  - The passage mentions mahouts and training only to explain how elephants learned the rope task before cooperation was tested.  
  - It ignores the larger claim about elephants’ understanding of when they need a partner.

- **Option B (Correct)*:**  
  - Accurately captures a central idea: elephants show advanced cooperative understanding and join an “elite club” of social cooperators.  
  - Matches how the idea is developed:  
    - The introduction states elephants recognize when they need a partner and places them with chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.  
    - Middle paragraphs describe the rope experiments showing elephants wait for partners and give up when a partner cannot help.  
    - The final paragraph adds expert comments and comparisons (to chimpanzees and rooks) that support and extend the claim.  

- **Option C (Incorrect):**  
  - Focuses on physical strength (“move heavy objects”) rather than cognitive cooperation.  
  - The corn table and lifting a fallen companion are used to illustrate cooperation and understanding, not raw power.  
  - This option confuses examples of cooperative behavior with a different, unsupported central idea.

- **Option D (Incorrect):**  
  - Over-narrows the central idea to patience alone.  
  - While the text notes that elephants can “inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees, this is presented as one piece of evidence for their cooperative understanding, not the main point.  
  - It ignores the broader claim about social cognition and needing a partner’s help.

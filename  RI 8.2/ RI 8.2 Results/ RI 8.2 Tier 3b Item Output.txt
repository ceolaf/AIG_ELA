Passage: RI 8.2 Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk (NJ grade 8 practice test).txt
Tier 3b (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7). (13.74 secs). (3110 + 568 = 3678 total tokens)

1. Which statement best explains how the author develops a central idea about elephants’ intelligence throughout the article?

A. The author introduces elephants’ need for help and then contrasts it with examples of animals that cannot cooperate successfully.  
B. The author presents a claim that elephants show advanced social cooperation, then explains experiments and field observations that support and deepen that idea over the course of the text.*  
C. The author argues that elephants are smarter than chimpanzees and rooks and uses the experiment only to prove that elephants always perform better.  
D. The author states that elephants can be trained to do tricks and then describes how mahouts teach them to pull ropes for food.

**Correct Answer: B***

### Rationales

**Option B (Key):**  
- The opening paragraph introduces a central idea: elephants have “higher social cognition” and can recognize when they need a partner’s help.  
- The second and third paragraphs describe a series of controlled experiments (the sliding table, rope-pulling, delayed release, and out-of-reach rope) that show elephants understanding when cooperation is necessary.  
- The final paragraph brings in outside experts and examples from nature (lifting a fallen companion, comparison to rooks and chimpanzees) that reinforce and extend this idea.  
- This option accurately captures both the central idea (advanced social cooperation/intelligence) and how it is developed through supporting ideas (experimental evidence, comparisons to other species, and field observations).

**Option A (Distractor):**  
- This suggests the author contrasts elephants with animals that “cannot cooperate successfully,” but the passage actually places elephants in an “elite club” with other successful cooperators (chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, humans).  
- There is no sustained pattern of contrasting elephants with non-cooperating animals, so this misrepresents how the central idea is developed.

**Option C (Distractor):**  
- The text does not claim elephants are simply “smarter” than chimpanzees and rooks or that they “always perform better.”  
- While it notes elephants learn one task faster than chimpanzees and that rooks fail to wait, the author uses these comparisons to situate elephants among other intelligent species, not to argue overall superiority.  
- This distorts both the central idea and the role of the supporting comparisons.

**Option D (Distractor):**  
- Training by mahouts is mentioned briefly as context for how elephants learned the rope task, but the central idea is not about “tricks” or training.  
- The main focus is on elephants’ own understanding of when cooperation is needed, not on human instruction.  
- This option focuses on a minor supporting detail and incorrectly elevates it to the central idea.

Tier 3b (GPT) #2 (temp=0.8). (10.67 secs). (3689 + 564 = 4253 total tokens)

2. How does the author most effectively show that elephants understand when cooperation is necessary?

A. By stating that elephants are part of an “elite club” of social cooperators and leaving the claim unsupported.  
B. By first describing the basic rope-pulling task and then adding more complex versions of the experiment, along with expert commentary, to show elephants recognize when a partner is needed.*  
C. By focusing mainly on how mahouts train elephants to pull ropes and then briefly mentioning wild behavior at the end.  
D. By listing several different animal species and comparing their habitats to that of elephants.

**Correct Answer: B***

### Rationales

**Option B (Key):**  
- The author begins with the basic cooperative rope-pulling task, showing elephants must pull together to get corn.  
- The study is then made more complex: elephants are released at different times, so one must wait for the other; later, one partner’s rope is placed out of reach, and the other elephant “just give[s] up.”  
- These escalating experimental conditions show elephants adjust their behavior based on whether cooperation is actually possible, which supports the idea that they understand when a partner is needed.  
- The final paragraph adds expert commentary and naturalistic examples (like elephants lifting a fallen companion), further reinforcing this idea.  
- This option accurately traces how the central idea (elephants’ understanding of cooperation) is developed through increasingly challenging tasks and outside expert support.

**Option A (Distractor):**  
- The “elite club” phrase appears early, but it is a claim, not the main method of development.  
- The article does not “leave the claim unsupported”; most of the passage is devoted to explaining experiments and expert reactions.  
- This option ignores the key role of the experiments and misrepresents how the idea is developed.

**Option C (Distractor):**  
- Mahout training is mentioned only briefly to explain how elephants learned the basic pulling action.  
- The focus of the article is not on training techniques, but on how elephants behave in different cooperative conditions once they know how to pull the rope.  
- Wild behavior is not “briefly mentioned at the end” as an afterthought; instead, it is used as additional evidence alongside the experiments, not as the main focus.

**Option D (Distractor):**  
- The passage does list other species (chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, humans), but it does not compare their habitats, and habitat is irrelevant to the central idea.  
- The comparisons are about performance on cooperative tasks and waiting behavior, not where they live.  
- This choice misidentifies both the supporting ideas and the way the central idea is developed.

Passage: RI 8.2 Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk (NJ grade 8 practice test).txt
Tier 3b (Claude) #1 (temp=0.7). (28.04 secs). (3406 + 819 = 4225 total tokens)

I'll create a multiple choice item aligned to RI.8.2 that focuses on determining a central idea and analyzing its development throughout the text.

## Draft Item:

**Stem:**
How does the author develop the central idea that elephants possess advanced social intelligence throughout the passage?

**Answer Options:**

A. By first explaining that elephants need help, then describing experiments that prove they can work together, and finally comparing their abilities to those of other intelligent animals*

B. By beginning with a description of elephant training methods, then explaining how trainers teach elephants tricks, and concluding with examples of elephant performances

C. By starting with observations of wild elephants, then describing laboratory experiments, and ending with criticism of previous research methods

D. By introducing the rope-pulling experiment, then explaining why it failed with most animals, and finally showing how elephants were the only species to succeed

**Rationales:**

**Option A (Key):** This correctly traces how the central idea develops: The passage opens by establishing that elephants understand when they need help (paragraph 1), then provides detailed evidence through the rope-pulling experiments (paragraphs 2-3), and concludes by comparing elephants' performance to other species like chimpanzees and rooks, placing them in an "elite club" (paragraphs 1 and 4). This shows the progression from claim to evidence to broader context.

**Option B (Distractor):** A student might select this if they focus on the mention of "mahouts" (trainers) in paragraph 2, but misunderstand the passage's purpose. The passage is not about training methods or performances but about scientific experiments revealing cognitive abilities.

**Option C (Distractor):** This reverses the actual structure. The passage begins with experimental findings and only briefly mentions wild observations near the end (paragraph 4). A student might choose this if they confuse the sequence of information.

**Option D (Distractor):** While the rope-pulling experiment is central, this option incorrectly states that elephants were the only successful species. The passage explicitly mentions that chimpanzees, hyenas, and rooks also demonstrate cooperation, though elephants performed better in some aspects.

Tier 3b (Claude) #2 (temp=0.8). (23.67 secs). (4239 + 838 = 5077 total tokens)

I'll create a different multiple choice item aligned to RI.8.2 that focuses on a different aspect of determining and analyzing a central idea's development.

## Draft Item:

**Stem:**
Which statement best describes how the author develops the central idea that scientific experiments can reveal complex cognitive abilities in animals?

**Answer Options:**

A. The author first presents the conclusion from a new study, then explains the experimental design in detail, and finally validates the findings through expert opinions and natural observations*

B. The author begins by criticizing old research methods, then introduces a completely new approach, and concludes by rejecting all previous findings about animal intelligence

C. The author starts with examples of elephant behavior in the wild, then questions whether these behaviors show intelligence, and ends by proving that only trained animals demonstrate cooperation

D. The author opens with a history of animal cognition research, then describes failed experiments with multiple species, and concludes that only elephants show true cooperation

**Rationales:**

**Option A (Key):** This accurately traces the development: The passage opens with the study's conclusion that elephants understand when they need help (paragraph 1), then provides detailed explanation of the rope-pulling experimental methodology and results (paragraphs 2-3), and concludes with validation from experts like Karen McComb and Nicola Clayton who connect the findings to natural observations and broader research (paragraph 4). This shows how scientific evidence builds to support the central idea.

**Option B (Distractor):** Students might select this if they misinterpret the phrase "modified a classic experiment" in paragraph 2 as criticism. However, the passage doesn't criticize old methods but rather adapts them, and it doesn't reject previous findings—it builds on them.

**Option C (Distractor):** This reverses the actual structure and misrepresents the conclusion. The passage starts with experimental findings, not wild observations, and it doesn't suggest that only trained animals show cooperation—it actually validates the experiments with wild observations.

**Option D (Distractor):** While the passage mentions the 1930s experiments, it doesn't provide a comprehensive history, nor does it describe failed experiments. Students might choose this if they misunderstand the comparative statements about different species' abilities.

## LBIDAT Analysis:

**Stem & Task:** ✓

“A grade 8 informational text should be built of ideas, some central or primary, and some supporting. Furthermore, central ideas should develop—or at least their presentation should—over the course of the text (e.g., expands, contracts, clarifies, problematizes, fades out, comes to dominate). This standard is about recognizing all of that interplay and structure in an informational text and consciously analyzing it or breaking it down. It requires test takers to recognize a central or primary idea—often one of multiple such ideas in a text—and how it relates to supporting ideas in the text. The answer options should lay out relationships or developments between a candidate central idea and candidates supporting ideas. Answer options may present different options for *how* a single idea has developed and/or how multiple different candidate ideas have developed.”

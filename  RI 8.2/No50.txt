the standard is not about just recognizing a summary of the text. Not merely identifying a central idea or theme in the text. Not just any idea or theme that is in the text, if not a central idea. Not merely recognizing a summary *word* for how the central idea develops. Not the test takers’ views, opinions or reaction to the text or that central ideas. Not about small details in the text, at all.

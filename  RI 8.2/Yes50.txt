“A recurring or developing idea or theme that can be traced through a text, and asks about recognizing *how* it develops over the course of the text (e.g., expands, contracts, clarifies, problematizes, fades out, comes to dominate). This must include that central or primary idea’s relationship to supporting or secondary ideas in the text. Includes picking out a central idea only if it also includes tracing its development.”

summarizing is a very sophisticated skill that entirely *requires* open constructed response item types, which are not available here. Merely recognizing an idea in the text, be it supporting or central is not a grade 8 skill. Merely characterizing the development is the previous standard in the progression (i.e., grade 7). Looking closely with sophisticated and rigorous close reading skills at specific details in the text and how they relate to the central or primary idea comes *later* in the anchor standard’s progression. Opinions about the text or ideas within it are not part of this standard, as they go beyond the contexts of the text.

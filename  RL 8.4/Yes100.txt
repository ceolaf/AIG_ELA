“At this level, this standard is about the relatively advanced skill of recognizing the particular use of a word—an author’s careful selection and use of a word that carries particular meaning *as* *it* *is* *used* *in* *this* *text*. This goes beyond mere denotative meaning to focus on the additional more subtle meanings that shape tone at least as much as it shapes meaning. This is often epitomized by recognizing how words used in perhaps unusual contexts or used non-literally add further layers of meaning that might notably alter the meaning of the local text to differ from the most literal understanding built of the denotative meanings. That is, it about meaning that goes beyond—or even could be in tension with—the literal denotative meaning of a word. It is about reading beyond the surface meaning of a text and recognizing how just a few words can significantly change a text’s meaning, when noticed by a more skillful reader.”

1. Read this sentence from the passage:

   “It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it **recedes** in the distance.”

   As it is used in this sentence, what is the best meaning of the word “recedes”?

   A. moves farther away from reach*  
   B. becomes less important  
   C. disappears completely  
   D. slows down gradually  

**Correct Answer: A***

---

### Rationales

**Option A: moves farther away from reach* (Correct)**  
- In the sentence, the narrator compares Dr. Blackwell’s approval to something that keeps moving away the more she tries to reach it.  
- The phrase “in the distance” and the structure “the more I seek…, the farther it recedes” suggest a figurative image of approval acting like a physical object that keeps moving away.  
- “Recedes” here means “moves farther away,” emphasizing the narrator’s frustration and the tone of discouragement.

**Option B: becomes less important (Distractor)**  
- “Becomes less important” is a possible meaning of “recede” in some contexts (like “the problem receded into the background”), so it may attract students who focus only on a general definition.  
- However, in this sentence, the narrator still cares deeply about Dr. Blackwell’s approval; it is not less important to her.  
- The imagery of “farther…in the distance” fits physical or emotional distance, not importance.

**Option C: disappears completely (Distractor)**  
- Some students may think “recedes” means “goes away entirely.”  
- But the text says “the farther it recedes,” not that it vanishes. The approval is still there, just harder to reach.  
- This overstates the meaning and doesn’t match the gradual, continuing sense implied by “farther.”

**Option D: slows down gradually (Distractor)**  
- “Recede” can be confused with words like “decelerate,” which relate to speed.  
- Nothing in the sentence suggests speed or slowing; instead, the focus is on distance and difficulty of attaining approval.  
- This choice ignores the figurative comparison of approval to something moving away in the distance, which shapes the tone of frustration and self-doubt.

================= NEW ITEM =================
Tier 6a (Claude) #1 (temp=0.7)

Here is a multiple choice item aligned to RL.8.4:

**Item:**

In the passage, the narrator describes her hope for Dr. Blackwell's approval by saying "It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance." What is the impact of the author's word choice in this phrase?

A. The word "recedes" suggests that the narrator's goal is moving away from her like an object disappearing into the distance, emphasizing her growing frustration and sense of hopelessness.

B. The word "distance" indicates that Dr. Blackwell is physically far away from the narrator during their interactions.

C. The phrase describes how the narrator is literally moving farther away from Dr. Blackwell each day.

*D. The word "recedes" compares the narrator's quest for approval to chasing something that keeps moving away, highlighting how her desperate efforts are actually counterproductive.

**Rationales:**

**Option A:** This response recognizes that "recedes" creates a metaphorical image of something moving away and correctly identifies the narrator's frustration. However, it focuses more on the emotional result rather than analyzing how the specific word choice reveals the counterproductive nature of her efforts—that her very attempts to gain approval are causing it to move further away.

**Option B:** This response demonstrates a literal, surface-level reading of "distance" without recognizing the figurative meaning of the phrase. The narrator is not describing physical distance but rather the metaphorical distance between herself and achieving Dr. Blackwell's approval.

**Option C:** This response completely misses the figurative language and interprets the phrase literally, as if the narrator is describing actual physical movement rather than the metaphorical relationship between her efforts and their results.

***Option D (Correct Answer):** This response demonstrates sophisticated understanding of how the author's word choice creates meaning beyond the literal level. "Recedes" evokes the image of chasing something that keeps moving away, which perfectly captures the ironic situation—the harder Diana tries to impress Dr. Blackwell, the more she fails. The word choice reveals the counterproductive cycle of her desperate efforts, adding a layer of meaning about how anxiety can undermine performance.

================= NEW ITEM =================
Tier 6a (Claude) #1 (temp=0.7)

Looking at this passage for RL.8.4 alignment, I need to focus on a word that students would know the denotative meaning of, but that carries deeper connotative or figurative meaning in this specific context. Let me identify a good focal word and create an assessment item.

**Multiple Choice Item:**

In the passage, the narrator describes seeking Dr. Blackwell's approval: "It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance." What is the effect of the author's word choice "recedes" in this context?

A. It emphasizes that the narrator is physically moving away from Dr. Blackwell during their interactions.

B. It suggests that the narrator's memory of wanting approval is fading over time.

C. It creates a tone of frustration by comparing approval to something that moves backward and becomes more distant despite the narrator's efforts.

*D. It conveys the narrator's sense of hopelessness by portraying approval as an elusive goal that becomes harder to reach the more she tries.

**Rationales:**

**Option A Rationale:** This response focuses on the literal, physical meaning of "recedes" (moving away in space). Students choosing this option are not recognizing the figurative use of the word and are instead applying only its denotative meaning to interpret a physical relationship between the characters.

**Option B Rationale:** This response confuses "recedes" with fading memory or diminishing desire. While "recede" can relate to things diminishing, students choosing this option misunderstand what is receding (the approval itself, not the narrator's memory or desire for it) and miss the figurative nature of the usage.

**Option C Rationale:** This response partially recognizes the figurative use of "recedes" and identifies some emotional impact (frustration), but it doesn't fully capture the deeper connotative meaning of hopelessness and the paradoxical nature of the situation that makes the word choice particularly effective in this context.

**Option D Rationale (Correct Answer):** This response demonstrates full understanding of how "recedes" works figuratively in this context. The word choice creates a visual metaphor of something moving away from someone who is pursuing it, which perfectly captures the narrator's sense of hopelessness and the paradoxical situation where trying harder actually seems to make success less likely. The connotative meaning goes beyond simple movement to suggest futility and despair.


================= NEW ITEM =================
Tier 6a (Claude) #2 (temp=0.8)

Looking at the passage for another word with rich connotative meaning, I'll focus on "extinguish" which carries deeper figurative meaning beyond its literal definition.

**Multiple Choice Item:**

In the passage, the narrator states: "I must somehow manage to do better, make no further mistakes, and gain the doctor's respect, or she will send me away. That would extinguish my hopes, for the Women's Medical College that Dr. Blackwell has founded here at the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children is the only institution of its kind." What is the impact of the author's choice to use "extinguish" in this context?

A. It suggests that the narrator's hopes would slowly fade away over time if she were dismissed.

B. It indicates that the narrator could easily rekindle her dreams at another medical school.

*C. It creates a tone of desperation by comparing her hopes to a flame that would be suddenly and completely destroyed.

D. It emphasizes that the narrator would need to eliminate her unrealistic expectations about becoming a doctor.

**Rationales:**

**Option A Rationale:** This response misses the specific connotative power of "extinguish," which implies sudden and complete destruction rather than gradual fading. Students choosing this option understand that hopes would end but don't grasp how the word choice emphasizes the abrupt and total nature of that ending, nor do they recognize the metaphorical comparison to fire/light being snuffed out.

**Option B Rationale:** This response completely misunderstands the figurative meaning of "extinguish" and contradicts the context. The passage explicitly states this is "the only institution of its kind," making it clear that rekindling hopes elsewhere isn't possible. Students choosing this option are not recognizing how "extinguish" connotes permanent destruction.

**Option C Rationale (Correct Answer):** This response demonstrates full understanding of the figurative power of "extinguish" in this context. The word creates an implicit metaphor comparing the narrator's hopes to a flame or light that can be suddenly and completely snuffed out. This word choice intensifies the emotional stakes and creates a tone of desperation, as it suggests not just disappointment but total destruction of her dreams. The connotative meaning emphasizes the finality and completeness of the potential loss.

**Option D Rationale:** This response misinterprets "extinguish" as something the narrator would do to herself (eliminating expectations) rather than something that would be done to her hopes by external circumstances. Students choosing this option miss both the passive construction and the figurative meaning, instead focusing on a literal interpretation of elimination that doesn't match the context.

================= NEW ITEM =================
Tier 6a (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7)

1. Read this sentence from the passage:

> “Every day has brought at least one similar scolding. **It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance.**”

What is the effect of the phrase “the farther it recedes in the distance” on the meaning and tone of the sentence?

A. It shows that Dr. Blackwell is actually moving away from the narrator in the clinic.  
B. It suggests that the narrator feels that earning Dr. Blackwell’s approval is becoming less and less likely over time.*  
C. It proves that the narrator does not care very much about Dr. Blackwell’s opinion.  
D. It indicates that the narrator plans to leave the clinic and go back home soon.

**Correct Answer: B***

**Rationales**

- **A. It shows that Dr. Blackwell is actually moving away from the narrator in the clinic.**  
  This takes the phrase literally, as if Dr. Blackwell is physically walking away. In context, “approval” is not a physical object, so the phrase is figurative, not about physical movement. This misreads the figurative language.

- **B. It suggests that the narrator feels that earning Dr. Blackwell’s approval is becoming less and less likely over time.*  
  “The farther it recedes in the distance” is a metaphor comparing approval to something you try to reach but that keeps moving away. This conveys the narrator’s growing frustration and discouragement, shaping a tone of self-doubt and disappointment. This correctly interprets the figurative meaning and its impact on tone.

- **C. It proves that the narrator does not care very much about Dr. Blackwell’s opinion.**  
  The sentence actually shows the opposite: the narrator is actively “seeking” Dr. Blackwell’s approval. The figurative phrase emphasizes how much she wants it but feels unable to attain it, not that she is indifferent.

- **D. It indicates that the narrator plans to leave the clinic and go back home soon.**  
  Nothing in this phrase states or implies a decision to leave. The image of approval “receding” expresses emotional distance and difficulty, not a concrete plan to quit. This confuses the feeling of discouragement with an action the text does not support.

Tier 6a (GPT) #2 (temp=0.8)

2. Read this sentence from the passage:

> “If I was hoping to find a **motherly figure** in Dr. Blackwell, I was quickly disabused of that notion.”

What does the phrase “motherly figure” suggest about the narrator’s expectations of Dr. Blackwell, and how does this choice of words affect the tone?

A. It suggests the narrator expected Dr. Blackwell to act like an actual parent, making the tone sound childish and immature.  
B. It suggests the narrator expected Dr. Blackwell to be a gentle guide and source of comfort, creating a tone of disappointment when this hope is denied.*  
C. It suggests the narrator believed Dr. Blackwell would treat her like a patient, creating a tone of fear and anxiety.  
D. It suggests the narrator thought Dr. Blackwell would be friendly but unimportant, creating a casual, relaxed tone.

**Correct Answer: B***

**Rationales**

- **A. It suggests the narrator expected Dr. Blackwell to act like an actual parent, making the tone sound childish and immature.**  
  “Motherly figure” is figurative; it does not mean a literal parent. The narrator is not presented as immature, but as someone seeking guidance and support. This misinterprets the connotation of “motherly.”

- **B. It suggests the narrator expected Dr. Blackwell to be a gentle guide and source of comfort, creating a tone of disappointment when this hope is denied.*  
  “Motherly figure” connotes warmth, protection, and nurturing. The phrase “I was quickly disabused of that notion” shows that this expectation was not met, which adds a disappointed, slightly hurt tone. This correctly connects the figurative meaning to the tone.

- **C. It suggests the narrator believed Dr. Blackwell would treat her like a patient, creating a tone of fear and anxiety.**  
  A “motherly figure” does not suggest being treated like a patient; it suggests care and guidance. The sentence does not emphasize fear or anxiety here, but a correction of mistaken expectations. This misreads the connotation.

- **D. It suggests the narrator thought Dr. Blackwell would be friendly but unimportant, creating a casual, relaxed tone.**  
  A “motherly figure” implies importance and emotional significance, not unimportance. The tone is not casual or relaxed; it is reflective and disappointed. This conflicts with both the word choice and the context.

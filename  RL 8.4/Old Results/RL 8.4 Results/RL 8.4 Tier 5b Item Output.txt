================= NEW ITEM =================
Passage: RL 8.4 Oh Pioneers (TN grade 8 Released 2023).txt
Tier 5b (Claude) #1 (temp=0.7)

I'll create a multiple choice item aligned to RL.8.4 that focuses on the connotative meaning and impact of word choices in this passage.

## Draft Item:

**Item Stem:**
In the third paragraph, the narrator describes Alexandra's sister as wearing "a man's long ulster (not as if it were an affliction, but as if it were very comfortable and belonged to her; carried it like a young soldier)."

How does the phrase "carried it like a young soldier" impact the meaning and tone of this description?

**Answer Options:**

A. It suggests that Alexandra is uncomfortable wearing men's clothing but tries to hide her embarrassment.

B. *It conveys that Alexandra wears the coat with confidence and purpose, establishing her as strong and self-assured.

C. It indicates that Alexandra borrowed the coat from someone in the military and feels proud to wear it.

D. It implies that Alexandra is trying to appear tougher than she really is to intimidate others in town.

## Rationales:

**Option A (Distractor):** Students might select this if they misread the parenthetical statement. The text explicitly states she does NOT wear it "as if it were an affliction," but students focusing only on the fact that it's men's clothing might assume discomfort.

**Option B (Key):** This is correct. The simile "like a young soldier" carries connotations of confidence, purpose, and strength. Combined with the earlier description that she wore it "as if it were very comfortable and belonged to her," this word choice establishes Alexandra as self-assured and practical, unconcerned with conventional gender expectations.

**Option C (Distractor):** Students might select this by taking the soldier comparison too literally, missing that it's a simile describing HOW she carries herself, not the origin of the coat.

**Option D (Distractor):** Students might choose this if they assume that wearing men's clothing and the soldier comparison means she's putting on a false front, but the text's tone suggests authenticity ("belonged to her") rather than pretense.

## LBIDAT Analysis:

**Stem & Task:** ✓
- The task directly addresses RL.8.4 by asking students to analyze how a specific word choice (simile) impacts meaning and tone
- Requires understanding connotative meaning beyond literal interpretation
- Appropriate for 8th grade level analysis

**The Key:** ✓
- Definitively correct and directly responsive to the question
- Captures both the connotative meaning and its impact on characterization

**Distractors:** ✓
- Each distractor represents a plausible misreading or misinterpretation
- All are definitively incorrect but arise from reasonable errors in analysis
- Each represents a different type of misunderstanding

**Stimulus:** ✓
- The passage provides necessary context
- Students must engage with the specific textual evidence to answer correctly
- Cannot be answered without careful reading of the passage

**Fairness:** ✓
- No inappropriate sensitivity topics
- Historical context is neutral and educational

## Final Version:

**In the third paragraph, the narrator describes Alexandra's sister as wearing "a man's long ulster (not as if it were an affliction, but as if it were very comfortable and belonged to her; carried it like a young soldier)."

How does the phrase "carried it like a young soldier" impact the meaning and tone of this description?**

Passage: RL 8.4 Oh Pioneers (TN grade 8 Released 2023).txt
Tier 5b (Claude) #2 (temp=0.8)

I'll create another multiple choice item aligned to RL.8.4, focusing on a different example of connotative meaning and word choice impact from the passage.

## Draft Item:

**Item Stem:**
In the first paragraph, the narrator describes the town's buildings as "huddled on the gray prairie" and states that "some of them looked as if they had been moved in overnight, and others as if they were straying off by themselves, headed straight for the open plain."

What is the impact of describing the buildings as "straying off" in this context?

**Answer Options:**

A. It emphasizes the organized and planned layout of the frontier town.

B. *It suggests the town lacks permanence and unity, as if even the buildings want to escape.

C. It indicates that the townspeople are actively relocating their homes to better locations.

D. It shows that the buildings are well-constructed and able to withstand the prairie winds.

## Rationales:

**Option A (Distractor):** Students might select this if they miss the connotative meaning entirely and assume any description of building placement implies organization, contradicting the text's statement that houses were "set about haphazard."

**Option B (Key):** This is correct. The personification of buildings "straying off" like wandering animals creates a sense of impermanence and disconnection. Combined with "headed straight for the open plain," it suggests even the inanimate structures seek escape from this harsh, temporary settlement.

**Option C (Distractor):** Students might choose this by interpreting "straying off" too literally as actual movement, missing that this is figurative language describing appearance and feeling rather than action.

**Option D (Distractor):** Students might select this if they focus on the fact that buildings are still standing despite the wind, missing how the connotation of "straying" actually emphasizes vulnerability and impermanence.

## LBIDAT Analysis:

**Stem & Task:** ✓
- Directly addresses RL.8.4 by examining figurative language and its impact
- Requires analysis of personification and its connotative meaning
- Appropriate complexity for 8th grade

**The Key:** ✓
- Definitively correct and directly answers the question
- Accurately captures the connotative impact of the word choice

**Distractors:** ✓
- Each represents a plausible misinterpretation
- All are definitively incorrect
- Each stems from a different type of reading error

**Stimulus:** ✓
- Passage context is essential for understanding
- Cannot be answered without engaging with the text
- The quoted portion works in conjunction with surrounding context

**Fairness:** ✓
- No sensitive topics
- Historical frontier setting is educational and neutral

## Final Version:

**In the first paragraph, the narrator describes the town's buildings as "huddled on the gray prairie" and states that "some of them looked as if they had been moved in overnight, and others as if they were straying off by themselves, headed straight for the open plain."

Passage: RL 8.4 Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant (MN grade 8 2018).txt
Tier 5b (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7)

1. Read this sentence from the passage.

> “It seems that the more I seek her approval, **the farther it recedes in the distance**.”

What is the effect of the phrase “the farther it recedes in the distance” on the meaning and tone of the sentence?

A. It suggests that Dr. Blackwell is physically moving away from Diana, creating a sense of loneliness.  
B. It shows that Diana believes Dr. Blackwell’s approval is becoming less and less likely, adding to her frustration and discouragement.*  
C. It means that Diana is spending less time with Dr. Blackwell, making her feel more relaxed and confident.  
D. It indicates that Dr. Blackwell has decided Diana will never become a doctor, creating a hopeless tone.

**Correct Answer: B***

---

### Rationales

**Option B (Key):**  
- The phrase “the farther it recedes in the distance” is figurative; approval cannot literally move away.  
- “Recedes in the distance” suggests something that seems to move farther away the more you try to reach it.  
- In context, Diana keeps trying to earn Dr. Blackwell’s approval but feels it is getting less attainable.  
- This deepens the tone of frustration and discouragement, matching her repeated scoldings and self-doubt.  

**Option A (Distractor):**  
- Misreads the phrase as literal physical distance.  
- The sentence is about “her approval,” not Dr. Blackwell herself moving away.  
- A student focusing only on the image of “distance” might incorrectly assume it refers to physical separation, but that does not fit the context of seeking “approval.”  

**Option C (Distractor):**  
- Claims Diana feels “more relaxed and confident,” which contradicts the passage.  
- The paragraph emphasizes that she feels “self-conscious” and fears being sent away.  
- A student who assumes “farther away” means “less pressure” might choose this, but it ignores the negative emotional context.  

**Option D (Distractor):**  
- Overstates the meaning; the text does not say Dr. Blackwell has decided anything permanent.  
- “Recedes in the distance” suggests difficulty and doubt, not a final decision that approval is impossible.  
- A student who interprets the phrase as absolute hopelessness might pick this, but it goes beyond what the figurative language supports.

Tier 5b (GPT) #2 (temp=0.8)

2. Read this sentence from the passage.

> “If I was hoping to find a **motherly figure** in Dr. Blackwell, I was quickly **disabused** of that notion.”

What do the words “motherly figure” and “disabused” together help reveal about Diana’s view of Dr. Blackwell?

A. Diana realizes that Dr. Blackwell is kinder and more gentle than she expected, which makes her feel safe.  
B. Diana understands that Dr. Blackwell is not warm or gently supportive like a mother, which makes her feel disappointed and uneasy.*  
C. Diana discovers that Dr. Blackwell is too inexperienced to guide her, which makes her feel worried about her training.  
D. Diana decides that Dr. Blackwell is distant and uncaring toward all patients, which makes her want to quit the clinic.

**Correct Answer: B***

---

### Rationales

**Option B (Key):**  
- “Motherly figure” connotes warmth, gentle guidance, and emotional support.  
- “Disabused” means being corrected or freed from a mistaken belief.  
- Together, they show that Diana had hoped Dr. Blackwell would be nurturing but has learned that this expectation was wrong.  
- This reveals her disappointment and uneasiness under Dr. Blackwell’s strict, public reprimands.

**Option A (Distractor):**  
- Misinterprets “disabused”; it does not mean confirmed or strengthened, but corrected.  
- Claims Dr. Blackwell is “kinder and more gentle than she expected,” which contradicts the passage’s examples of stern scoldings.  

**Option C (Distractor):**  
- Introduces the idea that Dr. Blackwell is “too inexperienced,” which the text never suggests.  
- The figurative phrase focuses on emotional style (not being “motherly”), not on medical skill or experience.  

**Option D (Distractor):**  
- Overgeneralizes that Dr. Blackwell is uncaring “toward all patients” and that Diana “wants to quit,” neither of which appears in the text.  
- Confuses Diana’s personal disappointment with a complete rejection of Dr. Blackwell or the clinic.

Passage: RL 8.4 Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant (MN grade 8 2018).txt
Tier 5b (Gemini) #1 (temp=0.7)

Here is a multiple-choice item aligned to CCSS RL.8.4, designed to meet the LBIDAT criteria.

**Item**

**Stem:**
Read the sentence from paragraph 7.

“Female physicians are still more of a **curiosity** than anything.”

What does the author’s use of the word *curiosity* suggest about the perception of female doctors at that time?

A. They were viewed as interesting novelties rather than trusted professionals. *
B. They were admired by the public for their unique and rare medical skills.
C. They were feared because their practices were considered strange and unknown.
D. They were constantly questioned by patients who were eager to learn about their lives.

**Rationales:**

*   **A (Key):** The word “curiosity” in this context refers to an object or person that is considered unusual or odd. The author uses it to define the status of female doctors as novelties to be looked at, rather than experts to be relied upon. This is supported by the surrounding text, which notes that patients are “not sure” about the doctors’ abilities and that the doctors are a “curiosity” despite the patients being “comfortable” with them personally. This option correctly identifies the connotative impact of the word as diminishing their professional standing.
*   **B (Distractor):** This option focuses on the “rarity” aspect of a curiosity (like a rare collectible) and applies a positive tone ("admired"). This is a plausible misconception if the student assumes that being unique equates to being highly valued. However, the text explicitly contradicts this by stating that patients lacked confidence in their abilities.
*   **C (Distractor):** This option focuses on the “strange” aspect of a curiosity and applies a negative emotional tone ("feared"). This is plausible because people often fear the unknown. However, the text states that the women were “more comfortable” with female doctors than male ones, indicating that fear was not the primary issue; rather, it was a lack of professional credibility.
*   **D (Distractor):** This option confuses the noun “a curiosity” (the object being observed) with the adjective “curious” (the feeling of the observer). A student might choose this if they conflate the word forms, assuming that because the doctors were a curiosity, the patients were acting *curiously* by asking questions.

***

**LBIDAT Evaluation Self-Check:**

*   **Stem & Task (✓):** The task asks the student to determine the impact of a specific word choice (*curiosity*) on the meaning/tone regarding the characters. This is directly aligned to RL.8.4 ("analyze the impact of specific word choices on meaning and tone"). It targets the "advanced skill" of recognizing how a common word used in a specific context (labeling a professional as a "curiosity") shapes the text's meaning beyond a simple definition.
*   **The Key (✓):** The key is definitively correct based on the text. The text contrasts the "curiosity" label with being "confident in our abilities," supporting the interpretation that they were seen as novelties, not experts.
*   **Distractors (✓):**
    *   All distractors are responsive to the stem (they all describe a perception of the doctors).
    *   All are plausible: B appeals to positive bias/rarity; C appeals to negative bias/fear; D appeals to a common root-word confusion (curiosity vs. curious).
    *   All are definitively incorrect based on textual evidence (lack of confidence contradicts B; patient comfort contradicts C; lack of dialogue/questions contradicts D).
*   **Stimulus (✓):** The item accurately reflects paragraph 7 of the passage.
*   **Fairness (✓):** The item discusses historical gender roles in a professional context, which is the subject of the passage, but does not raise inappropriate sensitivity issues or elicit emotional distress.

Passage: RL 8.4 Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant (MN grade 8 2018).txt
Tier 5b (Gemini) #2 (temp=0.8)

Here is a multiple-choice item aligned to CCSS RL.8.4, designed to meet the LBIDAT criteria.

**Item**

**Stem:**
Read the sentence from paragraph 4.

“It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it **recedes** in the distance.”

What does the author’s use of the word *recedes* suggest about the narrator’s situation?

A. It suggests that the narrator feels her goal of pleasing Dr. Blackwell is becoming impossible to reach. *
B. It implies that Dr. Blackwell is physically walking away from the narrator during their conversations.
C. It indicates that the narrator is slowly losing her desire to become a doctor.
D. It reveals that Dr. Blackwell is gradually lowering her standards for the narrator.

**Rationales:**

*   **A (Key):** The word “recedes” denotes the action of moving back or further away from a previous position. In this context, the author uses it metaphorically to describe “approval.” By describing approval as something that moves farther away the harder the narrator tries to reach it, the author creates a tone of futility and frustration, suggesting the goal is unattainable or elusive.
*   **B (Distractor):** This option relies on the literal, denotative meaning of “recedes” (physical movement). It is a plausible distractor for students who fail to recognize the figurative usage of the word in relation to the abstract concept of “approval.”
*   **C (Distractor):** This option misapplies the word “recedes” (fading/withdrawing) to the narrator’s *ambition* rather than the doctor’s *approval*. It is plausible because “receding” can describe a fading memory or feeling, but the text explicitly states the narrator is seeking approval, not losing interest.
*   **D (Distractor):** This option interprets “recedes” as diminishing or lowering (like a receding floodwater), leading to the conclusion that the standards are lowering. This is definitively incorrect because the phrase “farther... in the distance” implies the standard is getting harder to reach, not easier.

***

**LBIDAT Evaluation Self-Check:**

*   **Stem & Task (✓):** The task requires the student to analyze the impact of a specific word choice (*recedes*) on the meaning of the text. This aligns with RL.8.4’s focus on "figurative and connotative meanings" and "recognizing the particular use of a word" beyond its literal definition.
*   **The Key (✓):** The key is definitively correct. The metaphor of a destination moving away as one approaches establishes the feeling of an unreachable goal.
*   **Distractors (✓):**
    *   All distractors are responsive to the stem.
    *   Distractor B addresses the literal vs. figurative disconnect.
    *   Distractor C addresses a misapplication of the subject (narrator vs. doctor).
    *   Distractor D addresses a misinterpretation of the directionality/implication of the word.
    *   None are duplicates or result from the same error.
*   **Stimulus (✓):** The item accurately reflects paragraph 4.
*   **Fairness (✓):** The item deals with the frustration of learning and seeking approval from a mentor, which is a standard, relatable theme and does not raise inappropriate sensitivity issues.

Passage: RL 8.4 Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant (MN grade 8 2018).txt
Tier 5b (Claude) #1 (temp=0.7)

Looking at this passage and the requirements for RL.8.4, I need to create an item that focuses on how specific word choices impact meaning and tone beyond just literal definitions. The item should test students' ability to recognize connotative meanings and how authors carefully select words to shape meaning in context.

Here's my multiple choice item:

---

In paragraph 4, the narrator says that Dr. Blackwell's approval "recedes in the distance." What does this phrase suggest about the narrator's relationship with Dr. Blackwell?

A. The narrator believes Dr. Blackwell is becoming physically ill and may need to retire from medicine.

B. The narrator feels that earning Dr. Blackwell's respect becomes more impossible the harder she tries.* 

C. The narrator thinks Dr. Blackwell is planning to move her medical practice to another city.

D. The narrator realizes that Dr. Blackwell treats all her students exactly the same way.

**Rationales:**

**Option A (Distractor):** This response comes from a literal misreading of "recedes," interpreting it as physical weakness or decline rather than as a metaphorical expression about something becoming more distant or unattainable. Students selecting this miss the figurative nature of the language.

**Option B (Key):** This is correct because "recedes in the distance" is used figuratively to convey the paradox that the more desperately the narrator seeks approval, the more unattainable it becomes. The phrase creates a sense of futility and frustration, suggesting that her efforts are counterproductive. This metaphorical use of spatial distance to represent emotional/professional distance captures the complex dynamic between the narrator and Dr. Blackwell.

**Option C (Distractor):** This response misinterprets "distance" literally as geographical distance, missing that the phrase is figurative. Students might select this if they focus on the concrete meaning of "distance" without considering the metaphorical context of the relationship being described.

**Option D (Distractor):** While the passage does show Dr. Blackwell being strict, this option misses the specific connotation of "recedes in the distance" which emphasizes the narrator's personal struggle and the seeming impossibility of her goal. This distractor represents a plausible but surface-level interpretation that doesn't capture the figurative meaning of the phrase.

---

**Final Version:**

In paragraph 4, the narrator says that Dr. Blackwell's approval "recedes in the distance." What does this phrase suggest about the narrator's relationship with Dr. Blackwell?

A. The narrator believes Dr. Blackwell is becoming physically ill and may need to retire from medicine.

B. The narrator feels that earning Dr. Blackwell's respect becomes more impossible the harder she tries.*

C. The narrator thinks Dr. Blackwell is planning to move her medical practice to another city.

D. The narrator realizes that Dr. Blackwell treats all her students exactly the same way.

Looking at the passage for another opportunity to assess RL.8.4, I'll focus on a different phrase that carries connotative meaning beyond its literal definition.

In paragraph 9, the narrator describes feeling "unjustly reprimanded, like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar." How does this comparison shape the reader's understanding of the narrator's emotional state?

A. It shows that the narrator recognizes she deserves punishment for making serious medical errors.

B. It reveals that the narrator feels unfairly shamed for trying to show compassion to a patient.*

C. It suggests that the narrator is too young and inexperienced to work in a medical setting.

D. It indicates that the narrator has been stealing supplies from Dr. Blackwell's clinic.

**Rationales:**

**Option A (Distractor):** This misinterprets the word "unjustly" which explicitly tells us the narrator feels the reprimand is undeserved. Students selecting this option miss the key modifier that establishes the narrator's perspective on the fairness of the scolding.

**Option B (Key):** This is correct because the simile comparing her to "a child caught sneaking sweets" emphasizes both the shame she feels and the triviality of her "offense" (speaking soothingly to a nervous patient). The word "unjustly" combined with this childish comparison creates a tone of frustration and highlights the disconnect between her professional intentions and how she's being treated. The comparison suggests she feels belittled and misunderstood.

**Option C (Distractor):** This takes the child comparison too literally, missing that it's the narrator's subjective feeling about how she's being treated, not an objective assessment of her capabilities. The passage actually shows she's an experienced battlefield nurse.

**Option D (Distractor):** This completely misreads the figurative language by taking "sneaking sweets from a jar" literally rather than understanding it as a simile about feeling guilty for something innocent. This represents a fundamental misunderstanding of figurative language.

---

**Final Version:**

In paragraph 9, the narrator describes feeling "unjustly reprimanded, like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar." How does this comparison shape the reader's understanding of the narrator's emotional state?

A. It shows that the narrator recognizes she deserves punishment for making serious medical errors.

B. It reveals that the narrator feels unfairly shamed for trying to show compassion to a patient.*

C. It suggests that the narrator is too young and inexperienced to work in a medical setting.

D. It indicates that the narrator has been stealing supplies from Dr. Blackwell's clinic.

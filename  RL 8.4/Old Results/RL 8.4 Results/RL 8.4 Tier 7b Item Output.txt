Passage: RL 8.4 Oh Pioneers (TN grade 8 Released 2023).txt
Tier 7b (Claude) #1 (temp=0.7)

Looking at this passage from *O Pioneers!*, I'll create a multiple choice item aligned to RL.8.4 that focuses on how specific word choices impact meaning and tone beyond literal interpretation.

**Item:**

In the third paragraph, the author describes Alexandra as wearing a man's long ulster "not as if it were an affliction, but as if it were very comfortable and belonged to her; carried it like a young soldier." How does the phrase "carried it like a young soldier" impact the meaning and tone of Alexandra's characterization?

A. It suggests Alexandra is embarrassed about wearing men's clothing but tries to hide her discomfort.

B. It indicates Alexandra has military training that helps her navigate the harsh Nebraska environment.

C. *It conveys that Alexandra wears the coat with confidence and purpose, establishing her as someone who defies conventional expectations.

D. It shows that Alexandra borrowed the coat from someone in the military and doesn't know how else to wear it.

**Rationales:**

**Option A (Distractor):** This represents a misreading of the connotative meaning. A student selecting this option fails to recognize that the comparison to a soldier carries connotations of confidence and bearing, not embarrassment. The text explicitly states she wears it "not as if it were an affliction," which contradicts this interpretation.

**Option B (Distractor):** This represents taking the figurative language too literally. The student mistakes the simile "like a young soldier" for actual military experience, missing that this is a comparison meant to convey how she carries herself, not her actual background.

**Option C (Key):** This correctly identifies how the comparison to a soldier adds layers of meaning about Alexandra's character. The military comparison suggests confidence, purpose, and strength—qualities that, combined with her wearing men's clothing comfortably, establish her as someone who doesn't conform to traditional gender expectations of the time period.

**Option D (Distractor):** This represents a failure to recognize the figurative nature of the comparison and projects a literal explanation not supported by the text. The student invents a backstory about borrowing the coat that isn't present in the passage.

**Final Version:**

In the third paragraph, the author describes Alexandra as wearing a man's long ulster "not as if it were an affliction, but as if it were very comfortable and belonged to her; carried it like a young soldier." How does the phrase "carried it like a young soldier" impact the meaning and tone of Alexandra's characterization?

A. It suggests Alexandra is embarrassed about wearing men's clothing but tries to hide her discomfort.

B. It indicates Alexandra has military training that helps her navigate the harsh Nebraska environment.

C. *It conveys that Alexandra wears the coat with confidence and purpose, establishing her as someone who defies conventional expectations.

D. It shows that Alexandra borrowed the coat from someone in the military and doesn't know how else to wear it.

Passage: RL 8.4 Oh Pioneers (TN grade 8 Released 2023).txt
Tier 7b (Claude) #2 (temp=0.8)

Looking at this passage from *O Pioneers!*, I'll create another multiple choice item aligned to RL.8.4 that examines how specific word choices shape meaning and tone beyond literal interpretation.

**Item:**

In the first paragraph, the author describes the town of Hanover as "anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland, was trying not to be blown away." How does the word "anchored" impact the meaning and tone of this description?

A. It indicates that the town has a large harbor where ships dock for safety from storms.

B. *It creates irony by suggesting stability while the rest of the description emphasizes the town's fragility and impermanence.

C. It explains that the town's buildings are literally chained to the ground to prevent wind damage.

D. It shows that the town is growing stronger and more established over time.

**Rationales:**

**Option A (Distractor):** This represents a failure to consider context and applies only the most common denotative meaning of "anchored" related to ships. The student doesn't recognize that Nebraska is landlocked and the word is being used metaphorically.

**Option B (Key):** This correctly identifies how "anchored" creates a tension with the surrounding description. While "anchored" typically connotes security and stability, the author immediately undercuts this with "trying not to be blown away" and later descriptions of buildings that "looked as if they had been moved in overnight" and had "no appearance of permanence." This ironic juxtaposition emphasizes the town's vulnerability.

**Option C (Distractor):** This takes the figurative language too literally, missing that "anchored" is metaphorical. The student fails to recognize this as figurative language describing the town's precarious position.

**Option D (Distractor):** This projects a meaning about growth and progress that contradicts the actual description in the text. The student misses how the word choice actually emphasizes vulnerability rather than strength, ignoring the context that follows.

**Final Version:**

In the first paragraph, the author describes the town of Hanover as "anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland, was trying not to be blown away." How does the word "anchored" impact the meaning and tone of this description?

A. It indicates that the town has a large harbor where ships dock for safety from storms.

B. *It creates irony by suggesting stability while the rest of the description emphasizes the town's fragility and impermanence.

C. It explains that the town's buildings are literally chained to the ground to prevent wind damage.

D. It shows that the town is growing stronger and more established over time.

Passage: RL 8.4 Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant (MN grade 8 2018).txt
Tier 7b (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7)

1. Read this sentence from the passage.

> “It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it **recedes** in the distance.”

In this sentence, the word “recedes” most strongly suggests that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is—

A. calmly waiting for Diana to notice it  
B. slowly moving away from Diana over time*  
C. completely unimportant to Diana’s future  
D. hidden from everyone in the hospital  

**Correct Answer: B***

---

### Rationales

**A. calmly waiting for Diana to notice it**  
- This treats “recedes” as if the approval is just sitting still, which ignores the image of something moving away.  
- It does not match the narrator’s frustration that the approval seems harder to reach the more she tries.

**B. slowly moving away from Diana over time***  
- “Recedes in the distance” is figurative language suggesting that approval feels like something she is chasing but that keeps moving farther away.  
- This captures both the literal sense of “recede” (to move back or farther away) and its connotation here: her goal feels less and less reachable, which adds to the tone of discouragement.

**C. completely unimportant to Diana’s future**  
- Nothing in the sentence or passage suggests that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is unimportant; in fact, Diana fears being sent away without it.  
- This misreads the figurative phrase and ignores its emotional impact on the narrator.

**D. hidden from everyone in the hospital**  
- “Recedes in the distance” does not suggest hiding; it suggests moving away.  
- The approval may be hard for Diana to obtain, but the passage does not say it is hidden or unknown to others, only that it feels out of her reach.

Passage: RL 8.4 Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant (MN grade 8 2018).txt
Tier 7b (GPT) #2 (temp=0.8)

2. Read this sentence from the passage.

> “If I was hoping to find a motherly figure in Dr. Blackwell, I was quickly **disabused** of that notion.”

As it is used in this sentence, the word “disabused” most strongly contributes to the idea that the narrator—

A. was gently encouraged to keep believing Dr. Blackwell was motherly  
B. was suddenly corrected and made to abandon her mistaken belief*  
C. chose to ignore all evidence about Dr. Blackwell’s real personality  
D. was warned not to share her private thoughts with Dr. Blackwell  

**Correct Answer: B***

---

### Rationales

**A. was gently encouraged to keep believing Dr. Blackwell was motherly**  
- “Disabused” suggests being set free from a wrong idea, not encouraged to keep it.  
- This reverses the meaning and ignores the contrast between “hoping” and “quickly disabused,” which shows her hope was taken away.

**B. was suddenly corrected and made to abandon her mistaken belief***  
- “Disabused of that notion” is figurative language meaning she was made to give up a false idea.  
- The adverb “quickly” and the context of being sharply reprimanded show that her belief in a “motherly figure” was corrected in a firm, almost harsh way, shaping a disappointed, sober tone.

**C. chose to ignore all evidence about Dr. Blackwell’s real personality**  
- “Disabused” implies she *accepted* the correction, not that she ignored it.  
- This option conflicts with the sentence, which shows her realizing she was wrong.

**D. was warned not to share her private thoughts with Dr. Blackwell**  
- The sentence focuses on changing her belief about Dr. Blackwell’s *character*, not on whether she should share thoughts.  
- This adds an idea not supported by the text and does not reflect the figurative use of “disabused.”

================= NEW ITEM =================
Passage: RL 8.4 Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant (MN grade 8 2018).txt
Tier 7b (Gemini) #1 (temp=0.7)

**Item Alignment:** Common Core State Standard RL.8.4
**Passage:** Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant

**Item Stem:**
Read the sentence from paragraph 9.

“Once again, I felt unjustly reprimanded, like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar.”

How does the author’s use of the analogy “like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar” impact the meaning of the passage?

**Answer Options:**
A. It suggests that Diana has been stealing supplies from the clinic to give to her patients.
B. It emphasizes Diana’s feeling of shame and smallness, even though she believes her actions were harmless. *
C. It implies that Dr. Blackwell is acting like a protective mother who is trying to keep Diana safe from harm.
D. It indicates that Diana does not take her job seriously and prefers to behave like a playful child.

**Rationales:**
*   **Option A (Distractor):** This option relies on a literal interpretation of the word “sneaking” and the idea of taking something ("sweets"). It incorrectly applies the vehicle of the simile (stealing candy) to the reality of the story (Diana was speaking to a patient), ignoring the figurative nature of the comparison.
*   **Option B (Key):** The analogy compares Diana’s feeling to that of a child (a position of inferiority) caught doing something tempting but ultimately minor (eating candy). This choice correctly analyzes how the comparison highlights Diana's powerlessness and guilt under Dr. Blackwell’s gaze ("caught"), while the choice of "sweets" and the word "unjustly" reinforce that Diana felt her "crime" (soothing a patient) was actually something good or benign, not deserving of such a harsh reaction.
*   **Option C (Distractor):** This option focuses on the "child" element of the analogy but misinterprets the tone. It assumes that being treated like a child implies protection or affection (a positive motherly role), which contradicts the context of being "reprimanded" and "snapped" at.
*   **Option D (Distractor):** This option mischaracterizes the tone of the passage. It interprets the reference to a "child" and "sweets" as evidence that Diana is playful or immature. However, the context of the passage shows Diana is anxious ("fingers trembled," "bit my tongue") and striving for respect, not that she is casually playing around.

Passage: RL 8.4 Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant (MN grade 8 2018).txt
Tier 7b (Gemini) #2 (temp=0.8)

**Item Alignment:** Common Core State Standard RL.8.4
**Passage:** Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant

**Item Stem:**
Read the sentence from paragraph 7.

“Female physicians are still more of a curiosity than anything.”

How does the author’s use of the word *curiosity* in this sentence impact the meaning of the passage?

**Answer Options:**
A. It suggests that the patients are asking many questions because they are eager to learn about the new medical treatments.
B. It implies that the female doctors are viewed by the public as strange novelties rather than as legitimate professionals. *
C. It indicates that the community fears the doctors and believes they are keeping dangerous secrets.
D. It emphasizes the intense desire for knowledge that motivated Dr. Blackwell and Diana to pursue medicine.

**Rationales:**
*   **Option A (Distractor):** This option relies on the most common denotative meaning of "curiosity" (the desire to know or learn). It incorrectly applies this trait to the patients, ignoring the grammatical phrasing ("*a* curiosity") which identifies the doctors as the *object* of attention, not the patients as the inquirers.
*   **Option B (Key):** This option correctly identifies the connotation of being "a curiosity" in this context. It recognizes that the word suggests the women are seen as oddities or spectacles to be looked at. This shapes the meaning of the paragraph by highlighting the lack of professional respect and the skepticism the women face, despite their qualifications.
*   **Option C (Distractor):** This option misinterprets the tone. While "curiosity" implies something unusual, this distractor projects a much darker, thriller-genre tone ("dangerous secrets") that is not supported by the text. The text describes the patients as needy or skeptical, not fearful of danger.
*   **Option D (Distractor):** This option confuses the subject of the sentence. It applies the trait of curiosity to the doctors' internal motivation (which is discussed elsewhere in the text, such as in paragraph 3) rather than describing how they are perceived by the outside world in this specific sentence.

Passage: RL 8.4 Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant (MN grade 8 2018).txt
Tier 7b (Claude) #1 (temp=0.7)

Looking at this passage and the requirements for RL.8.4, I need to create an item that focuses on how specific word choices impact meaning and tone beyond their literal definitions. The item should test students' ability to recognize connotative meanings and their effects on the text.

Here's my multiple choice item:

**Item:**

In paragraph 4, the narrator says that Dr. Blackwell's approval "recedes in the distance." How does this phrase impact the meaning and tone of the paragraph?

A. It suggests that the narrator is physically moving away from Dr. Blackwell during their work together.

B. It creates a sense of hopelessness by comparing the approval to something unreachable that keeps getting farther away.*

C. It shows that Dr. Blackwell is becoming less strict with the narrator over time.

D. It indicates that the narrator has stopped caring about gaining Dr. Blackwell's respect.

**Rationales:**

**Option A (Distractor):** This response mistakes the figurative language for literal meaning. Students selecting this option are focusing only on the denotative meaning of "recedes in the distance" as physical movement, missing that this is a metaphorical expression about an emotional/professional relationship.

**Option B (Key):** This is correct because it recognizes how the phrase functions figuratively to convey the narrator's growing desperation. The image of something receding into the distance creates a tone of futility and emphasizes the seeming impossibility of earning Dr. Blackwell's approval, no matter how hard the narrator tries. This connotative meaning reinforces the paragraph's overall tone of self-doubt and anxiety.

**Option C (Distractor):** This misinterprets the impact of the phrase entirely, suggesting the opposite of what the context indicates. The paragraph clearly shows Dr. Blackwell continuing to be harsh and critical, not becoming less strict. This represents a mischaracterization of the phrase's impact on tone.

**Option D (Distractor):** This contradicts the context, as the paragraph explicitly states "I must somehow manage to do better... and gain the doctor's respect." Students choosing this option are projecting a meaning that isn't supported by the surrounding text and misunderstanding how the phrase relates to the narrator's emotional state.

**LBIDAT Evaluation:**
- Stem & Task: ✓ (Appropriately targets connotative meaning and impact on tone)
- The Key: ✓ (Definitively correct and directly responsive)
- Distractors: ✓ (Each represents a different type of error in understanding figurative language)
- Stimulus: ✓ (Passage is necessary and appropriately complex)

Passage: RL 8.4 Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant (MN grade 8 2018).txt
Tier 7b (Claude) #2 (temp=0.8)

Looking at the passage for another opportunity to assess RL.8.4, I'll focus on a different word choice that carries connotative meaning beyond its literal definition.

**Item:**

In paragraph 9, when the narrator says she "bit my tongue and said nothing," how does this phrase choice affect the meaning and tone of her interaction with Dr. Blackwell?

A. It emphasizes the narrator's submissive acceptance of unfair treatment by using a phrase that suggests self-inflicted pain.*

B. It shows that the narrator was physically hurt and unable to speak properly.

C. It indicates that the narrator is planning to argue with Dr. Blackwell later.

D. It demonstrates that the narrator agrees with Dr. Blackwell's criticism.

**Rationales:**

**Option A (Key):** This is correct because the idiom "bit my tongue" carries connotations of forced self-restraint and suppression of one's true feelings. The phrase creates a tone of frustration and powerlessness, as the narrator must literally hurt herself (metaphorically) to avoid speaking up against what she perceives as unjust treatment. This word choice emphasizes the power imbalance and the narrator's difficult position as someone who must endure criticism she believes is unfair.

**Option B (Distractor):** This response fails to recognize the figurative nature of the expression, taking "bit my tongue" literally as a physical action. Students selecting this miss the idiomatic meaning entirely and focus only on denotative meaning.

**Option C (Distractor):** This projects a meaning not supported by the text. The phrase suggests immediate suppression of response, not delayed confrontation. This represents a misunderstanding of how the phrase functions to show the narrator's resignation rather than planning future action.

**Option D (Distractor):** This misinterprets the connotative meaning. The context clearly shows the narrator feels "unjustly reprimanded," so biting her tongue indicates suppressing disagreement, not expressing agreement. This is a mischaracterization of the phrase's impact on the meaning of the scene.

**LBIDAT Evaluation:**
- Stem & Task: ✓ (Appropriately targets how phrase choice affects meaning and tone)
- The Key: ✓ (Definitively correct and directly responsive)
- Distractors: ✓ (Each represents a distinct error in understanding figurative language)
- Stimulus: ✓ (Passage context is necessary to understand the relationship dynamics)
- Fairness: ✓ (No sensitivity issues)

Passage: RL 8.4 Oh Pioneers (TN grade 8 Released 2023).txt
Tier 7a (Claude) #1 (temp=0.7)

Looking at this passage, I'll create an item that focuses on how Cather uses the word "anchored" to establish tone and meaning beyond its literal definition.

**Draft Item:**

In the opening paragraph, the author describes the town of Hanover as "anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland." How does the word "anchored" impact the meaning and tone of this description?

A. It suggests the town is permanently secured to the land, creating a tone of stability and permanence.

B. It implies the town is barely holding on against powerful forces, creating a tone of precariousness and struggle.

C. It indicates the town serves as a port for travelers, creating a tone of welcome and hospitality.

D. It shows the town was carefully planned and positioned, creating a tone of order and intentionality.

**Rationales:**

**Option A (Distractor):** This represents a surface-level reading that takes "anchored" at its most literal, positive connotation without considering the context. The student fails to recognize how the subsequent descriptions of buildings that "looked as if they had been moved in overnight" and had "no appearance of permanence" contradict this interpretation.

**Option B (Correct Answer)*:** This captures how Cather uses "anchored" ironically or with tension. The word typically suggests security, but in context with "trying not to be blown away" and the descriptions of impermanent, haphazard buildings, it conveys the opposite—that the town is desperately clinging to existence against hostile natural forces, like a ship anchored in a storm.

**Option C (Distractor):** This mistakes the nautical origin of "anchored" for its actual use in the passage, projecting a meaning that isn't supported by the text. The student is making an association with anchors and ports that doesn't align with the prairie setting or the tone of struggle.

**Option D (Distractor):** This misreads the connotation entirely, failing to account for the immediate context that describes buildings "set about haphazard" and the overall tone of disorder and impermanence established throughout the paragraph.

**Final Version:**

In the opening paragraph, the author describes the town of Hanover as "anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland." How does the word "anchored" impact the meaning and tone of this description?

A. It suggests the town is permanently secured to the land, creating a tone of stability and permanence.

*B. It implies the town is barely holding on against powerful forces, creating a tone of precariousness and struggle.

C. It indicates the town serves as a port for travelers, creating a tone of welcome and hospitality.

D. It shows the town was carefully planned and positioned, creating a tone of order and intentionality.

Passage: RL 8.4 Oh Pioneers (TN grade 8 Released 2023).txt
Tier 7a (Claude) #2 (temp=0.8)

Looking at this passage, I'll create an item that focuses on how Cather uses the word "straggled" to convey meaning about the town's character.

**Draft Item:**

The author describes the buildings along the main street as "straggled two uneven rows of wooden buildings." How does the word "straggled" shape the meaning and tone of this description?

A. It emphasizes how the buildings spread out inefficiently, creating a tone of disorganization and lack of cohesion.

B. It highlights the buildings' strategic spacing for fire safety, creating a tone of practical wisdom.

C. It shows the buildings were arranged in a decorative pattern, creating a tone of rural charm.

D. It indicates the buildings were damaged by weather, creating a tone of decay and abandonment.

**Rationales:**

**Option A (Correct Answer)*:** This captures how "straggled" conveys disorder and irregularity. Rather than simply saying the buildings were "arranged" or "lined," Cather chooses a word that suggests they trail along without order or unity, reinforcing the passage's overall tone of a settlement lacking permanence or planning—a town that seems to have grown haphazardly rather than been deliberately built.

**Option B (Distractor):** This represents a misreading that projects a practical rationale not present in the text. The student is trying to find a positive or intentional reason for the arrangement, missing how "straggled" carries connotations of disorder rather than deliberate planning.

**Option C (Distractor):** This completely mischaracterizes the connotation of "straggled," which suggests disorder rather than decoration. The student fails to recognize the negative connotations of the word and how it contributes to the harsh, unforgiving portrait of the frontier town.

**Option D (Distractor):** While this picks up on a negative tone, it misattributes the cause. "Straggled" describes arrangement pattern, not physical condition. The student is conflating this word's impact with other descriptions of weather effects in the passage, projecting meaning that isn't carried by this particular word choice.

**Final Version:**

The author describes the buildings along the main street as "straggled two uneven rows of wooden buildings." How does the word "straggled" shape the meaning and tone of this description?

*A. It emphasizes how the buildings spread out inefficiently, creating a tone of disorganization and lack of cohesion.

B. It highlights the buildings' strategic spacing for fire safety, creating a tone of practical wisdom.

C. It shows the buildings were arranged in a decorative pattern, creating a tone of rural charm.

D. It indicates the buildings were damaged by weather, creating a tone of decay and abandonment.

Passage: RL 8.4 Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant (MN grade 8 2018).txt
Tier 7a (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7)

1. Read this sentence from the passage:

> “Every day has brought at least one similar scolding. It seems that the more I seek her approval, **the farther it recedes in the distance**.”

What is the effect of the phrase “the farther it recedes in the distance” on the meaning and tone of this sentence?

A. It shows that Dr. Blackwell is physically moving away from the narrator, making her feel lonely.  
B. It suggests that the narrator’s goal of earning Dr. Blackwell’s approval feels like it is slipping out of reach.*  
C. It reveals that the narrator plans to leave the clinic and return home to her parents soon.  
D. It shows that the narrator does not really care about Dr. Blackwell’s opinion anymore.

**Correct Answer: B***

**Rationales**

- **A. It shows that Dr. Blackwell is physically moving away from the narrator, making her feel lonely.**  
  This misreads the phrase literally. “Recedes in the distance” is figurative; it refers to approval as if it were a physical object moving away. The text focuses on approval, not physical distance or loneliness.

- **B. It suggests that the narrator’s goal of earning Dr. Blackwell’s approval feels like it is slipping out of reach.*  
  This correctly interprets the figurative language. “The farther it recedes in the distance” conveys that, emotionally and psychologically, the narrator feels Dr. Blackwell’s approval is becoming less attainable the more she tries, adding a frustrated, discouraged tone.

- **C. It reveals that the narrator plans to leave the clinic and return home to her parents soon.**  
  This projects a meaning not supported by the sentence. The phrase doesn’t indicate her plans; it describes how distant approval feels. The narrator actually wants to stay and gain respect, not return home.

- **D. It shows that the narrator does not really care about Dr. Blackwell’s opinion anymore.**  
  This is the opposite of the passage’s meaning. The narrator clearly cares deeply about Dr. Blackwell’s approval (“the more I seek her approval”), and the figurative phrase emphasizes her disappointment, not indifference.

Tier 7a (GPT) #2 (temp=0.8)

2. Read this sentence from the passage:

> “If I was hoping to find a **motherly figure** in Dr. Blackwell, I was quickly disabused of that notion.”

How does the phrase “motherly figure” affect the meaning and tone of this sentence?

A. It emphasizes that Dr. Blackwell is old and physically weak, like an elderly mother.  
B. It shows that the narrator expected Dr. Blackwell to be gentle and nurturing, which makes Dr. Blackwell’s strictness feel more disappointing.*  
C. It suggests that Dr. Blackwell is related to the narrator by blood, which explains their conflict.  
D. It indicates that the narrator does not respect Dr. Blackwell as a real doctor, only as a parent-like helper.

**Correct Answer: B***

**Rationales**

- **A. It emphasizes that Dr. Blackwell is old and physically weak, like an elderly mother.**  
  This takes “motherly” too literally. The text never describes Dr. Blackwell as weak or elderly. “Motherly figure” here is about emotional qualities (warmth, comfort), not age or strength.

- **B. It shows that the narrator expected Dr. Blackwell to be gentle and nurturing, which makes Dr. Blackwell’s strictness feel more disappointing.*  
  This correctly interprets the connotation of “motherly figure” as kind, protective, and supportive. The phrase sets up a contrast with Dr. Blackwell’s public reprimands, deepening the narrator’s sense of letdown and adding a tone of hurt and disillusionment.

- **C. It suggests that Dr. Blackwell is related to the narrator by blood, which explains their conflict.**  
  “Motherly figure” is figurative, not literal; it does not mean they are related. The passage clearly presents Dr. Blackwell as a mentor, not a family member.

- **D. It indicates that the narrator does not respect Dr. Blackwell as a real doctor, only as a parent-like helper.**  
  This contradicts the passage, where the narrator calls Dr. Blackwell her “heroine” and hopes to follow in her footsteps. The phrase instead reveals high expectations for emotional support, not a lack of professional respect.

Passage: RL 8.4 Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant (MN grade 8 2018).txt
Tier 7a (Gemini) #1 (temp=0.7)

**Item for Grade 8: RL.8.4 (Word Choice, Connotation, and Tone)**

**Passage:** Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant

**Item:**

Read the sentence from paragraph 5.

“That would **extinguish** my hopes, for the Women’s Medical College that Dr. Blackwell has founded here at the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children is the only institution of its kind.”

What is the impact of the author’s use of the word **extinguish** in this sentence?

A. It implies that the narrator’s anger toward Dr. Blackwell is like a dangerous fire that must be stopped.
B. It indicates that the work is physically exhausting and the narrator feels her energy fading away.
C. It suggests that the narrator believes she needs to lower her expectations to a more realistic level.
D. It emphasizes the devastating finality of failure by comparing the narrator's ambition to a light being put out.*

**Rationales:**

*   **Option A** is incorrect. This response misinterprets the target of the metaphor. While "extinguish" is associated with fire, and fire can symbolize anger, the context of the paragraph focuses on the narrator's desire to succeed and her fear of failure, not anger toward her mentor.
*   **Option B** is incorrect. This response relies on a physical or literal interpretation of a flame dying out (losing energy/burnout). While the narrator is working hard, the word "extinguish" in this context refers to her specific career aspirations ("hopes") being ended by an external force (being sent away), not internal exhaustion.
*   **Option C** is incorrect. This response weakens the intensity of the word choice. "Extinguish" means to put out completely, whereas lowering expectations implies a modification or reduction. This option fails to capture the absolute nature of the loss described in the text.
*   **Option D** is correct. The word "extinguish" literally means to put out a fire or light. By applying this word to "hopes," the author utilizes a metaphor that equates the narrator's dream of becoming a doctor with a living flame. The impact of the word conveys that being sent away would not just be a setback, but would result in the total and permanent darkness of her future prospects, creating a tone of desperation and high stakes.

Tier 7a (Gemini) #2 (temp=0.8)

**Item for Grade 8: RL.8.4 (Word Choice, Connotation, and Tone)**

**Passage:** Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant

**Item:**

Read the sentence from paragraph 2.

“The idea of a woman doctor still required some adjustment, even though I **harbored** the hope of becoming one myself someday.”

What is the impact of the author’s use of the word **harbored** in this sentence?

A. It implies that the narrator feels guilty about her desire to be a doctor, as if she is hiding a crime.
B. It suggests that the narrator feels trapped by her ambition, like a ship that is unable to leave a port.
C. It conveys that the narrator protects her dream deep inside herself, keeping it safe from a doubting world.*
D. It emphasizes that the narrator has been waiting patiently for a very long time to begin her medical training.

**Rationales:**

*   **Option A** is incorrect. This response relies on a common negative association with the word (e.g., "harboring a fugitive"). It misinterprets the tone of the passage, introducing feelings of guilt or illegality, whereas the narrator’s tone is one of determined aspiration despite social disapproval.
*   **Option B** is incorrect. This response relies on a concrete or literal association with a harbor (a place where ships park or stay). It incorrectly projects a feeling of being stuck or limited, which contradicts the forward-looking nature of "hope."
*   **Option C** is correct. The literal definition of "harbor" is to provide shelter or a safe haven, usually for a ship. By using this word metaphorically with "hope," the author suggests that the narrator is sheltering this fragile ambition within her mind, protecting it from a society that still finds the idea of a female doctor strange ("required some adjustment").
*   **Option D** is incorrect. This response projects a specific timeline onto the word that is not inherent in its meaning. While "harbored" implies a state of holding, it focuses on the manner of holding (protection/shelter) rather than the duration (since childhood/long time).

Passage: RL 8.4 Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant (MN grade 8 2018).txt
Tier 7a (Claude) #1 (temp=0.7)

Looking at this passage, I need to find a word or phrase that carries connotative meaning beyond its literal definition and impacts the tone of the text. Let me identify a strong example that meets the RL.8.4 standard requirements.

In paragraph 4, the phrase "extinguish my hopes" stands out as particularly powerful figurative language that shapes both meaning and tone.

Here's my item:

---

**In paragraph 4, the narrator says that being sent away would "extinguish my hopes" of becoming a doctor. How does the word "extinguish" impact the meaning and tone of this statement?**

A. It suggests that the narrator's dreams are fragile and easily destroyed, like a flame that can be snuffed out, creating a tone of vulnerability and desperation.

B. It indicates that the narrator is angry about the possibility of failure, comparing her emotions to a fire that needs to be put out.

C. It shows that the narrator views her hopes as dangerous, like a fire that could spread if not controlled properly.

D. It reveals that the narrator has already given up on her dreams and expects them to end naturally over time.

**Answer Key and Rationales:**

***A. It suggests that the narrator's dreams are fragile and easily destroyed, like a flame that can be snuffed out, creating a tone of vulnerability and desperation.**
This is correct. The connotative meaning of "extinguish" (typically used with fire) when applied to "hopes" creates a metaphor that emphasizes how precarious and delicate the narrator's aspirations are. The word choice conveys both the complete finality of what would happen if she's dismissed and her desperate need to succeed, establishing a tone of vulnerability and high stakes.

B. It indicates that the narrator is angry about the possibility of failure, comparing her emotions to a fire that needs to be put out.
This misinterprets the connotation by focusing on anger rather than loss. The student is confusing the metaphorical use of fire-related language with emotional heat/anger, missing that "extinguish" here refers to destruction of hopes, not calming of emotions.

C. It shows that the narrator views her hopes as dangerous, like a fire that could spread if not controlled properly.
This distractor projects a meaning not supported by the context. The student is taking the fire metaphor too literally and attributing negative qualities to the hopes themselves, rather than understanding that the extinguishing represents loss.

D. It reveals that the narrator has already given up on her dreams and expects them to end naturally over time.
This misreads both the connotation and the context. "Extinguish" implies an external force ending something abruptly, not a natural fading. The student has missed the active, violent nature of extinguishing versus passive ending.

---

This item effectively assesses RL.8.4 because it requires students to recognize how the author's choice of "extinguish" rather than a more literal word like "end" or "ruin" creates specific connotations that shape our understanding of the narrator's emotional state and the stakes of her situation.


================= NEW ITEM =================
Passage: RL 8.4 Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant (MN grade 8 2018).txt
Tier 7a (Claude) #2 (temp=0.8)

Looking for another word or phrase with significant connotative meaning, I'll focus on paragraph 4 where Diana describes Dr. Blackwell's teaching style.

---

**In paragraph 4, when describing her mistakes under Dr. Blackwell's supervision, the narrator says "the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance." How does the word "recedes" impact the meaning and tone of this statement?**

A. It emphasizes the narrator's growing frustration by comparing approval to something mechanical that breaks down when used too much.

B. It creates a sense of futility by comparing approval to something like a tide or horizon that naturally moves away as one approaches it.

C. It suggests the narrator is becoming confused, as if approval is something that literally moves backward in space.

D. It shows that Dr. Blackwell is deliberately hiding her feelings to test the narrator's determination.

**Answer Key and Rationales:**

***B. It creates a sense of futility by comparing approval to something like a tide or horizon that naturally moves away as one approaches it.**
This is correct. "Recedes" carries connotations of natural, inevitable withdrawal (like tides receding or objects receding in the distance). This word choice suggests that the harder Diana tries, the more impossible her goal becomes—creating a tone of futility and frustration. The connotation implies an almost cosmic unfairness to her situation, where effort paradoxically increases distance from the goal.

A. It emphasizes the narrator's growing frustration by comparing approval to something mechanical that breaks down when used too much.
This distractor misinterprets the connotation of "recedes." The student is confusing withdrawal/distance with mechanical failure. "Recedes" doesn't suggest breakdown but rather natural movement away, missing the spatial metaphor entirely.

C. It suggests the narrator is becoming confused, as if approval is something that literally moves backward in space.
This takes the word too literally and misses the figurative meaning. The student fails to recognize this as metaphorical language about emotional distance, instead interpreting it as confusion about physical space.

D. It shows that Dr. Blackwell is deliberately hiding her feelings to test the narrator's determination.
This projects intentionality that isn't supported by the word choice. While "recedes" does imply movement away, it suggests natural or inevitable movement rather than deliberate action. The student is adding meaning about Dr. Blackwell's motivations that the word itself doesn't convey.

---

This item effectively assesses RL.8.4 because it requires students to understand how "recedes"—typically used for physical movement—when applied to "approval" creates a metaphor that conveys both the psychological distance between Diana and her mentor and the seemingly impossible nature of earning that approval.

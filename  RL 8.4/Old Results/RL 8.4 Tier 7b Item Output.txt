1. Read this sentence from the passage:

> “It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it **recedes** in the distance.”

As it is used in this sentence, what is the effect of the word **“recedes”** on the meaning and tone of the narrator’s description of Dr. Blackwell’s approval?

B. It shows that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is moving away from Diana, making it feel harder and harder for her to attain.*  
C. It implies that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is unimportant to Diana and slowly fading from her mind.  
D. It indicates that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is permanently gone and that Diana has completely given up on earning it.

---

### Rationales

**Correct Answer: B. It shows that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is moving away from Diana, making it feel harder and harder for her to attain.***  
- “Recedes” literally means to move back or away from a point.  
- In this figurative use, Dr. Blackwell’s *approval* is treated like a distant object that keeps moving farther away the more Diana tries to reach it.  
- This word choice emphasizes Diana’s frustration and insecurity: her efforts seem to push approval out of reach, which darkens the tone and makes it feel discouraging rather than hopeful.  
- This directly reflects the sentence: “the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance.”

**A. It suggests that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is calmly waiting for Diana to reach it whenever she is ready.**  
- This ignores the connotation of “recedes,” which implies movement *away*, not waiting in place.  
- It misreads the tone: the passage shows Diana feeling anxious and discouraged, not calm or confident.  
- This is a generic, non–passage-based interpretation that does not account for the figurative use in context.

**C. It implies that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is unimportant to Diana and slowly fading from her mind.**  
- The passage shows the opposite: Diana desperately wants Dr. Blackwell’s approval (“the more I seek her approval”).  
- “Recedes” here does not mean Diana is forgetting or caring less; it means the approval feels more distant as she tries harder.  
- This answer mischaracterizes both the meaning and the emotional tone.

**D. It indicates that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is permanently gone and that Diana has completely given up on earning it.**  
- “Recedes” suggests increasing distance, not total disappearance.  
- Diana has *not* given up; she still thinks, “I must somehow manage to do better, make no further mistakes, and gain the doctor’s respect.”  
- This overstates the impact of the word and projects a meaning (permanent loss, complete surrender) that is not supported by the text.

================= NEW ITEM =================
Tier 7b (Claude) #1 (temp=0.7)

**Multiple Choice Item**

In the passage, when Diana describes her hopes as something that "would extinguish," the author's choice of this word primarily serves to:

A. emphasize the literal danger of working with medical instruments and chemicals in the clinic
B. suggest that Diana's dreams are as fragile as a candle flame that could be easily blown out
*C. convey the complete and irreversible destruction that failure would bring to Diana's aspirations
D. indicate that Diana's passion for medicine burns as brightly as a fire

**Rationales:**

**Option A:** This response focuses on a literal interpretation of "extinguish" related to fire safety in a medical setting. This represents the misconception of not recognizing the figurative/connotative meaning of the word and instead applying a denotative meaning that doesn't fit the context. The passage is discussing Diana's hopes and dreams, not physical safety concerns.

**Option B:** While this response recognizes that "extinguish" is being used figuratively and connects it to something fragile that could be blown out, it mischaracterizes the impact on tone. The word "extinguish" in this context suggests something more final and devastating than mere fragility. This represents a partial understanding of connotation but an incomplete grasp of the word's full impact in context.

***Option C (Key):** This response correctly identifies how "extinguish" carries connotations of complete, final, and irreversible destruction. In the context of Diana's hopes and dreams, the author's choice of "extinguish" rather than words like "end" or "stop" emphasizes the totality and permanence of what failure would mean to her. This creates a tone of desperation and high stakes, showing how crucial this opportunity is to Diana's future.

**Option D:** This response projects meaning that isn't supported by the text. While it recognizes figurative language, it incorrectly suggests that "extinguish" is being used to show the brightness of Diana's passion, when the word actually refers to what would happen if she fails. This represents the misconception of projecting meaning into the word that doesn't align with how it's actually used in the passage.

================= NEW ITEM =================
Tier 7b (Claude) #1 (temp=0.7)

Looking at this passage, I can identify several words and phrases that would work well for RL.8.4. Let me create an item focusing on the phrase "extinguish my hopes" which carries strong connotative meaning beyond its literal definition.

**Multiple Choice Item:**

In the passage, the narrator states that being sent away "would extinguish my hopes." In this context, the word "extinguish" suggests that the narrator's hopes are

A. fragile and could be easily damaged by criticism
B. *like a flame that could be completely put out forever*  
C. similar to a candle that burns too brightly
D. comparable to a fire that needs constant fuel to survive

**Rationales:**

**A. fragile and could be easily damaged by criticism**
This distractor focuses on the narrator's sensitivity to Dr. Blackwell's criticism, which is evident throughout the passage. However, "extinguish" doesn't simply mean "damage"—it implies complete elimination. A student might choose this because they recognize the narrator's vulnerability but miss the finality that "extinguish" conveys in this context. This represents the misconception of not fully recognizing the connotative meaning.

**B. *like a flame that could be completely put out forever* (CORRECT)**
This is the key because "extinguish" in this context carries the connotative meaning of complete and permanent elimination, like putting out a fire. The narrator emphasizes this finality by explaining that Dr. Blackwell's institution "is the only institution of its kind," meaning there would be no other opportunity. The metaphorical use of "extinguish" creates a tone of desperation and finality that goes beyond the literal meaning of simply "ending" something.

**C. similar to a candle that burns too brightly**
This distractor might appeal to students who recognize that "extinguish" relates to flames/fire but misunderstand what aspect of the metaphor is being emphasized. The passage doesn't suggest the narrator's hopes are excessive or burning "too brightly"—rather, it focuses on the possibility of them being completely eliminated. This represents mischaracterizing the impact on tone.

**D. comparable to a fire that needs constant fuel to survive**
This distractor also recognizes the fire metaphor but incorrectly focuses on the idea of hopes needing maintenance or support. While the narrator does need Dr. Blackwell's approval, "extinguish" in this context emphasizes the complete elimination of hope rather than the ongoing need for sustenance. This represents getting the connotations wrong due to a generic interpretation that doesn't fully consider the specific context.

**LBIDAT Evaluation:**
- **Stem & Task: ✓** - Directly targets RL.8.4 by asking students to analyze connotative meaning and word choice impact
- **Key: ✓** - Definitively correct and responsive to the question
- **Distractors: ✓** - All plausible, based on different misconceptions about connotative meaning
- **Stimulus: ✓** - Requires close reading of the passage context
- **Fairness: ✓** - No inappropriate sensitivity issues


================= NEW ITEM =================
Tier 7b (Claude) #2 (temp=0.8)

Looking at this passage, I can create an item focusing on the phrase "recedes in the distance" which uses figurative language to convey meaning beyond the literal.

**Multiple Choice Item:**

In the passage, the narrator states, "It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance." The phrase "recedes in the distance" suggests that Dr. Blackwell's approval is

A. something the narrator can see clearly but cannot reach
B. *like a destination that moves farther away as she tries to approach it*
C. similar to an object that becomes smaller over time
D. comparable to something that was once close but is now far away

**Rationales:**

**A. something the narrator can see clearly but cannot reach**
This distractor might appeal to students who understand that "recedes in the distance" involves something being far away, but it misses the key aspect of movement. The metaphor isn't about static distance or clarity of vision—it's about the dynamic process of something moving away as one pursues it. This represents not fully recognizing the connotative meaning of the progressive action implied by "recedes."

**B. *like a destination that moves farther away as she tries to approach it* (CORRECT)**
This is the key because "recedes in the distance" creates a metaphor comparing approval to a physical destination that moves away as one approaches it. The word "recedes" suggests backward movement, and the context ("the more I seek...the farther it recedes") emphasizes the paradoxical nature of her situation—her efforts actually seem to make success less attainable. This figurative language creates a tone of frustration and futility that goes beyond simply saying "I can't get her approval."

**C. similar to an object that becomes smaller over time**
This distractor focuses on the visual aspect of something receding (appearing smaller as it moves away) but misses the crucial element of pursuit and the cause-and-effect relationship described. Students might choose this because they understand that receding things appear smaller, but they're not grasping how the metaphor specifically relates to the narrator's active seeking of approval. This represents a generic interpretation that doesn't fully consider the passage context.

**D. comparable to something that was once close but is now far away**
This distractor might appeal to students who think about the narrator's initial hopes versus her current discouragement. However, "recedes" implies ongoing movement away, not a static change from past to present. The passage shows that approval moves farther away as she tries harder, not that it was once close and is now distant. This represents mischaracterizing the impact on tone by missing the active, ongoing nature of the problem.

**LBIDAT Evaluation:**
- **Stem & Task: ✓** - Directly targets RL.8.4 by asking students to analyze figurative meaning and word choice impact
- **Key: ✓** - Definitively correct and responsive to the question about the metaphorical meaning
- **Distractors: ✓** - All plausible, based on different aspects of the literal/visual meaning of "recedes" 
- **Stimulus: ✓** - Requires understanding the specific context of the narrator's relationship with Dr. Blackwell
- **Fairness: ✓** - No inappropriate sensitivity issues

================= NEW ITEM =================
Tier 7b (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7)

1. Read this sentence from the passage:

> “Every day has brought at least one similar scolding. **It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance.**”

In this sentence, what is the effect of the phrase “the farther it recedes in the distance” on the meaning and tone of the narrator’s reflection?

A. It suggests that Dr. Blackwell is physically moving away from the narrator, creating a lonely, abandoned tone.  
B. It shows that the narrator’s goal of earning approval feels like something she is chasing but cannot catch, adding a tone of frustration and discouragement.*  
C. It proves that Dr. Blackwell is deliberately trying to prevent the narrator from becoming a doctor, creating a tone of anger.  
D. It indicates that the narrator is no longer interested in Dr. Blackwell’s opinion, creating a calm, indifferent tone.  

**Rationales**

**A. It suggests that Dr. Blackwell is physically moving away from the narrator, creating a lonely, abandoned tone.**  
- Misinterprets the figurative language as literal. “Recedes in the distance” is about approval, not Dr. Blackwell’s body.  
- The tone here is not focused on physical loneliness but on emotional struggle and self-doubt.

**B. It shows that the narrator’s goal of earning approval feels like something she is chasing but cannot catch, adding a tone of frustration and discouragement.*  
- Correct. “The farther it recedes in the distance” is a metaphor comparing approval to something that moves away as she moves toward it.  
- This figurative choice emphasizes how unreachable Dr. Blackwell’s approval feels, reinforcing the narrator’s discouragement and frustration with herself.

**C. It proves that Dr. Blackwell is deliberately trying to prevent the narrator from becoming a doctor, creating a tone of anger.**  
- Overstates what the text says; the sentence focuses on the narrator’s feelings, not on Dr. Blackwell’s intentions.  
- The tone is self-critical and discouraged, not angry or accusatory.

**D. It indicates that the narrator is no longer interested in Dr. Blackwell’s opinion, creating a calm, indifferent tone.**  
- Contradicts the sentence: “the more I seek her approval” shows she still cares deeply about that approval.  
- The figurative phrase intensifies her sense of failure, not indifference, so the tone is anything but calm.

Tier 7b (GPT) #2 (temp=0.8)

2. Read this sentence from the passage:

> “If I was hoping to find a motherly figure in Dr. Blackwell, I was quickly **disabused of that notion**.”

How does the phrase “disabused of that notion” affect the meaning and tone of this sentence?

A. It shows that the narrator happily changes her mind about wanting a mentor, creating a cheerful tone.  
B. It suggests that the narrator’s idea of Dr. Blackwell as “motherly” was corrected in a firm, somewhat harsh way, adding a tone of disappointment.*  
C. It proves that Dr. Blackwell dislikes the narrator personally, creating a resentful tone.  
D. It indicates that the narrator never really believed Dr. Blackwell could be “motherly,” creating a doubtful tone.  

**Rationales**

**A. It shows that the narrator happily changes her mind about wanting a mentor, creating a cheerful tone.**  
- Misreads the connotation of “disabused,” which implies a forced or unpleasant correction, not a happy one.  
- The surrounding context (public reprimands, “I felt that I could do nothing right”) supports disappointment, not cheerfulness.

**B. It suggests that the narrator’s idea of Dr. Blackwell as “motherly” was corrected in a firm, somewhat harsh way, adding a tone of disappointment.*  
- Correct. “Disabused of that notion” uses figurative, formal language to show her expectation was stripped away.  
- The phrase emphasizes that her hopeful belief has been undone, sharpening the tone of disillusionment and disappointment.

**C. It proves that Dr. Blackwell dislikes the narrator personally, creating a resentful tone.**  
- Overinterprets the phrase; “disabused” does not prove personal dislike, only that an idea was corrected.  
- The narrator does not express resentment; she still seeks Dr. Blackwell’s approval and respect.

**D. It indicates that the narrator never really believed Dr. Blackwell could be “motherly,” creating a doubtful tone.**  
- Contradicts the wording “If I was hoping to find a motherly figure…,” which shows she *did* have that hope.  
- “Disabused of that notion” signals that a real belief was taken away, not that she doubted it from the start.

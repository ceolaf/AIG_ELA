1. Read the sentence from the passage.

> “It seems that the more I seek her approval, the **farther it recedes in the distance**.”

What is the effect of the phrase “farther it recedes in the distance” on the meaning and tone of this sentence?

A. It suggests that Dr. Blackwell is literally moving away from the narrator in the clinic hallways.  
B. It shows that the narrator thinks Dr. Blackwell’s approval is becoming less realistic and harder for her to reach.*  
C. It indicates that the narrator has decided she no longer wants Dr. Blackwell’s approval.  
D. It reveals that Dr. Blackwell is unaware that the narrator wants her approval.

**Correct Answer: B***

---

### Rationales

**Option B (Key):**  
- The phrase “farther it recedes in the distance” is figurative, comparing Dr. Blackwell’s approval to something that keeps moving away as the narrator moves toward it.  
- This conveys that, emotionally, the approval feels less attainable the harder she tries, which deepens the tone of frustration and discouragement.  
- It does not describe a physical movement, but a growing emotional distance between the narrator and the goal of earning approval.

**Option A (Distractor):**  
- This takes the phrase literally, as if Dr. Blackwell is physically walking away.  
- The context is about “approval,” an abstract idea, not about physical location, so this interpretation ignores the figurative use of “recedes in the distance.”  
- A student focusing only on the literal meaning of “recedes” and “distance” might choose this, missing the connotative meaning.

**Option C (Distractor):**  
- The narrator still strongly wants Dr. Blackwell’s approval; she says, “I must somehow manage to do better… and gain the doctor’s respect.”  
- The phrase “farther it recedes” shows that the approval feels harder to reach, not that the narrator has stopped wanting it.  
- This reflects a misreading of tone, confusing discouragement with giving up.

**Option D (Distractor):**  
- The sentence focuses on the narrator’s feelings about her own efforts and how successful they seem, not on Dr. Blackwell’s awareness.  
- Nothing in the phrase “farther it recedes in the distance” indicates what Dr. Blackwell knows or doesn’t know.  
- A student might pick this if they confuse the narrator’s inner struggle with Dr. Blackwell’s perspective.

================= NEW ITEM =================
Tier 6b (Claude) #1 (temp=0.7)

Looking at this passage and the RL.8.4 standard, I'll focus on a word that carries connotative meaning beyond its literal definition and impacts the tone of the text.

**Item:**

In the passage, when Diana describes feeling "like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar" after being reprimanded by Dr. Blackwell, what does the word "sneaking" suggest about Diana's emotional state?

A. She feels guilty and ashamed, as if she has done something deliberately wrong
*B. She feels unfairly treated and diminished, like someone caught doing something innocent but forbidden
C. She feels proud of her independence and willingness to take risks
D. She feels confused about the hospital's rules regarding patient interaction

**Rationales:**

**A. She feels guilty and ashamed, as if she has done something deliberately wrong**
This focuses only on the literal meaning of "sneaking" as doing something wrong intentionally. While Diana does feel some shame, the analogy suggests her actions were innocent rather than deliberately wrong. The context shows she was appropriately comforting a patient, not doing something she knew was forbidden.

***B. She feels unfairly treated and diminished, like someone caught doing something innocent but forbidden** 
This correctly identifies the connotative meaning of "sneaking" in this context. The word choice creates a tone of injustice - Diana wasn't actually doing anything wrong (comforting patients is appropriate), yet she feels caught and guilty. The author's use of "sneaking sweets" rather than "stealing" or "breaking rules" emphasizes the innocence of the action, highlighting how Dr. Blackwell's harsh treatment makes Diana feel small and wrongly accused.

**C. She feels proud of her independence and willingness to take risks**
This misinterprets the emotional tone completely. "Sneaking" in this context, especially when "caught," suggests shame and diminishment, not pride. The analogy to a child being caught emphasizes vulnerability, not independence.

**D. She feels confused about the hospital's rules regarding patient interaction**
This misses the figurative meaning entirely. Diana isn't actually confused about rules - she knows comforting patients is appropriate. The "sneaking" analogy reveals her emotional response to unfair treatment, not literal confusion about hospital policies.

Tier 6b (Claude) #1 (temp=0.7)

**Multiple Choice Item for RL.8.4**

In the passage, when Diana describes feeling "like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar" after Dr. Blackwell's reprimand, this comparison reveals that Diana feels:

A. guilty about taking something that doesn't belong to her
B. embarrassed about being treated as immature and untrustworthy  
*C. shame and unfair punishment for behavior she considers innocent
D. nostalgic for the carefree days of childhood

**Rationales:**

**A. guilty about taking something that doesn't belong to her**
This response focuses only on the literal, denotative meaning of "sneaking sweets" without recognizing how the analogy functions in this context. Diana is not actually taking anything; she was comforting a patient. A student choosing this option is missing the figurative comparison and how it reveals Diana's emotional state about the reprimand itself.

**B. embarrassed about being treated as immature and untrustworthy**
This response recognizes that the comparison involves feelings of being treated like a child, which shows some understanding of the analogy's function. However, it doesn't capture the full connotative meaning that Diana specifically feels the punishment is unjust ("unjustly reprimanded" appears in the same sentence). The focus on "untrustworthy" also misses the key element of perceived unfairness.

***C. shame and unfair punishment for behavior she considers innocent (CORRECT)***
This response demonstrates full understanding of how the analogy functions beyond its literal meaning. The comparison to "a child caught sneaking sweets" in context reveals Diana's complex emotional response: she feels the shame of being caught and scolded, but believes her behavior (comforting a frightened patient) was innocent and helpful, much like a child might feel when punished for something they didn't think was wrong. The text supports this with "unjustly reprimanded," showing Diana believes the punishment doesn't fit her actions.

**D. nostalgic for the carefree days of childhood**
This response misinterprets the emotional tone of the analogy entirely. The comparison to being "caught" suggests shame and trouble, not positive nostalgia. A student choosing this option is not recognizing how the specific image chosen (being caught doing something wrong) creates meaning about Diana's current emotional state regarding the reprimand.

**LBIDAT Self-Assessment:**
- **Stem & Task: ✓** - Asks students to analyze how a specific figurative comparison reveals character feelings/perspective
- **Key: ✓** - Directly addresses how the analogy functions connotatively in context

Tier 6b (Claude) #2 (temp=0.8)

**Multiple Choice Item for RL.8.4**

In the passage, when Diana describes Dr. Blackwell's approval as something that "recedes in the distance," this word choice suggests that Diana views gaining her mentor's respect as:

A. something that moves away from her despite her efforts
B. a goal that is physically far away from where she stands
C. an objective that becomes smaller and less important over time
*D. an achievement that becomes more elusive the harder she pursues it

**Rationales:**

**A. something that moves away from her despite her efforts**
This response shows basic understanding that "recedes" involves movement away, but it misses the crucial connotative meaning established by the context. The phrase "the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes" creates a specific cause-and-effect relationship where Diana's very efforts seem to make success less likely. This option doesn't capture how her pursuit itself seems counterproductive.

**B. a goal that is physically far away from where she stands**
This response treats "recedes in the distance" too literally, focusing on the denotative meaning of physical distance rather than recognizing the metaphorical use. Diana isn't describing actual physical space but rather her psychological experience of trying to earn respect. A student choosing this option is missing the figurative nature of the language entirely.

***D. an achievement that becomes more elusive the harder she pursues it (CORRECT)***
This response demonstrates full understanding of how the author's word choice creates meaning beyond the literal. "Recedes in the distance" combined with "the more I seek her approval" creates the connotative meaning that Diana's very efforts to gain approval seem to push it further away—a paradox where trying harder makes success less likely. This captures the frustrating, self-defeating cycle Diana experiences in her relationship with Dr. Blackwell.

**C. an objective that becomes smaller and less important over time**
This response confuses "receding" with diminishing importance. While things that recede may appear smaller visually, the context makes clear that gaining Dr. Blackwell's approval remains critically important to Diana throughout the passage. The word choice isn't about changing priorities but about the frustrating dynamic of pursuit and evasion.

**LBIDAT Self-Assessment:**

================= NEW ITEM =================
Tier 6b (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7)

1. Which of the following best explains how the phrase “it recedes in the distance” (paragraph 4) affects the meaning and tone of the sentence “It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance”?

A. It suggests that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is something the narrator does not really want.  
B. It shows that Dr. Blackwell’s approval feels harder to reach the more the narrator tries to earn it.*  
C. It means that Dr. Blackwell is literally moving farther away from the narrator each day.  
D. It implies that the narrator will soon stop caring about Dr. Blackwell’s opinion.

**Rationales**

- **A. It suggests that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is something the narrator does not really want.**  
  This misreads the connotation of the phrase. The narrator clearly *does* want Dr. Blackwell’s approval (“the more I seek her approval”), so this does not fit how the phrase is used in the text.

- **B. It shows that Dr. Blackwell’s approval feels harder to reach the more the narrator tries to earn it.*  
  This is correct. The phrase “it recedes in the distance” is figurative language that compares Dr. Blackwell’s approval to something that keeps moving farther away. This word choice emphasizes how unreachable and discouraging the approval feels, shaping a frustrated, anxious tone.

- **C. It means that Dr. Blackwell is literally moving farther away from the narrator each day.**  
  This takes the phrase literally instead of figuratively. Nothing in the passage suggests physical distance; the “distance” refers to how difficult the approval feels to obtain, not where Dr. Blackwell is standing.

- **D. It implies that the narrator will soon stop caring about Dr. Blackwell’s opinion.**  
  This conflicts with the passage. The narrator’s concern about being “sent away” and having her hopes “extinguished” shows she continues to care deeply about Dr. Blackwell’s opinion; the phrase highlights her growing discouragement, not indifference.


================= NEW ITEM =================
Tier 6b (GPT) #2 (temp=0.8)

2. In paragraph 5, the narrator says that Dr. Blackwell’s medical college “is the only institution of its kind.” How does the phrase “of its kind” affect the meaning and tone of this sentence?

A. It suggests that the college is the only school in New York City.  
B. It emphasizes how rare and special a medical school for women is at that time.*  
C. It implies that the college is poorly known and unimportant.  
D. It indicates that the college will soon be replaced by many similar schools.

**Rationales**

- **A. It suggests that the college is the only school in New York City.**  
  This misinterprets the phrase. “Of its kind” refers to the *type* of institution (a women’s medical college), not its location. There is no claim that no other school exists in New York.

- **B. It emphasizes how rare and special a medical school for women is at that time.*  
  This is correct. “Of its kind” adds a connotative layer, underscoring that a medical college specifically for training women doctors is unique and precious. This word choice heightens the sense of urgency and importance in the narrator’s tone about not being “sent away.”

- **C. It implies that the college is poorly known and unimportant.**  
  The phrase does not suggest insignificance. In context, it does the opposite: it highlights the college’s importance because it is the only one like it, especially for women who want to become doctors.

- **D. It indicates that the college will soon be replaced by many similar schools.**  
  Nothing in “of its kind” or the surrounding text suggests that more such colleges are coming soon. The passage stresses present uniqueness, not future growth, so this reading goes beyond the text.

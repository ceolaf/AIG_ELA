Tier 2b (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7)

1. Read this sentence from the passage:

> “It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it **recedes** in the distance.”

As it is used in this sentence, what does the word “recedes” most nearly mean?

A. becomes less important to Diana over time  
B. moves farther away from Diana’s reach *  
C. changes into something different than Diana expected  
D. disappears completely from Diana’s mind  

**Correct Answer: B. moves farther away from Diana’s reach***

**Rationales**

- **A. becomes less important to Diana over time**  
  This is incorrect because approval is very important to Diana throughout the passage. She worries constantly about gaining Dr. Blackwell’s respect and fears being sent away, so the approval does not “become less important” to her.

- **B. moves farther away from Diana’s reach***  
  This is correct. The sentence compares approval to something in the distance that keeps moving away the more she tries to reach it. In context, “recedes” has a figurative meaning: the approval feels harder and harder to get, as if it is moving farther away.

- **C. changes into something different than Diana expected**  
  This is incorrect because nothing in the sentence suggests that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is changing in nature. Instead, the focus is on how difficult it is for Diana to obtain it, not on the approval itself becoming something different.

- **D. disappears completely from Diana’s mind**  
  This is incorrect because Diana continues to think about Dr. Blackwell’s approval and fears losing her position. The phrase “farther it recedes in the distance” suggests it is still there but out of reach, not gone from her thoughts.

Tier 2b (GPT) #2 (temp=0.8)

2. Read this sentence from the passage:

> “If I was hoping to find a **motherly figure** in Dr. Blackwell, I was quickly disabused of that notion.”

What is the effect of the phrase “motherly figure” on the tone of this sentence?

A. It makes the tone humorous by suggesting Diana expected Dr. Blackwell to joke with her.  
B. It makes the tone bitter by showing that Diana now dislikes Dr. Blackwell.  
C. It makes the tone wistful by revealing Diana’s desire for warmth and gentle support.*  
D. It makes the tone fearful by suggesting that Diana is afraid of older women.  

**Correct Answer: C. It makes the tone wistful by revealing Diana’s desire for warmth and gentle support.*  

**Rationales**

- **A. It makes the tone humorous by suggesting Diana expected Dr. Blackwell to joke with her.**  
  Incorrect. “Motherly” suggests kindness, guidance, and protection, not joking. Nothing in the sentence indicates humor; instead, it shows disappointment.

- **B. It makes the tone bitter by showing that Diana now dislikes Dr. Blackwell.**  
  Incorrect. The narrator does not say she dislikes Dr. Blackwell; she is disappointed that Dr. Blackwell is not as gentle as she hoped. The tone is more sad and reflective than angry or bitter.

- **C. It makes the tone wistful by revealing Diana’s desire for warmth and gentle support.*  
  Correct. Calling Dr. Blackwell a hoped-for “motherly figure” shows that Diana longed for nurturing guidance, and the phrase “I was quickly disabused of that notion” shows that this hope was not fulfilled. This combination creates a wistful, regretful tone.

- **D. It makes the tone fearful by suggesting that Diana is afraid of older women.**  
  Incorrect. The sentence does not express fear of older women; instead, it focuses on what Diana hoped Dr. Blackwell would be like emotionally (caring and supportive) and the disappointment when she is not.

Tier 2b (Claude) #1 (temp=0.7)

**Multiple Choice Item**

In the passage, when Diana says "the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance," what does this figurative language reveal about Diana's emotional state?

A. She is becoming increasingly confident in her medical abilities under Dr. Blackwell's guidance.

B. She is physically exhausted from the long hours of medical training and patient care.

*C. She feels frustrated and discouraged because her efforts to impress Dr. Blackwell seem to backfire.

D. She is growing more determined to prove that women can be as capable as male doctors.

**Rationales:**

**A. She is becoming increasingly confident in her medical abilities under Dr. Blackwell's guidance.**
This option contradicts the figurative language and context. The metaphor of approval "receding in the distance" suggests movement away from confidence, not toward it. The surrounding text describes Diana feeling self-conscious, making "clumsy blunders," and being repeatedly scolded, which indicates decreasing rather than increasing confidence.

**B. She is physically exhausted from the long hours of medical training and patient care.**
While Diana does work long hours, the figurative language specifically relates to seeking approval, not physical fatigue. The metaphor of something "receding in the distance" describes an emotional or psychological distance, not physical tiredness. The context focuses on her relationship with Dr. Blackwell and her desire for recognition, not her energy levels.

**C. She feels frustrated and discouraged because her efforts to impress Dr. Blackwell seem to backfire. [CORRECT]**
This option correctly interprets the figurative language. The metaphor of approval "receding in the distance" creates an image of something moving farther away despite Diana's efforts to reach it. The context supports this interpretation: Diana describes freezing "like a statue," making "clumsy blunders," and being repeatedly scolded. The phrase "the more I seek" indicates active effort, while "the farther it recedes" suggests that these very efforts are counterproductive, creating frustration and discouragement.

**D. She is growing more determined to prove that women can be as capable as male doctors.**
This option misinterprets the figurative language's emotional tone. While Diana does want to prove women's capabilities, the metaphor of approval "receding in the distance" suggests defeat and discouragement, not growing determination. The context shows her fear of being "sent away" and feeling that her "abilities" are "called into question," which indicates diminishing rather than increasing determination.

Tier 2b (Claude) #2 (temp=0.8)

**Multiple Choice Item**

In the passage, Diana describes feeling "like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar" when Dr. Blackwell reprimands her. How does this simile contribute to the overall tone of the passage?

A. It creates a lighthearted, humorous tone by comparing medical training to childhood mischief.

*B. It reinforces the tone of vulnerability and powerlessness that Diana experiences throughout her training.

C. It establishes a bitter, resentful tone toward Dr. Blackwell's teaching methods.

D. It develops a nostalgic tone by connecting Diana's current experiences to pleasant childhood memories.

**Rationales:**

**A. It creates a lighthearted, humorous tone by comparing medical training to childhood mischief.**
This option misreads the emotional weight of the simile. While the comparison involves a childhood scenario, the context is Diana feeling "unjustly reprimanded" and experiencing shame. The simile emphasizes her discomfort and diminished status, not humor. The overall passage tone focuses on Diana's struggles and insecurities, making a lighthearted interpretation inconsistent with the broader emotional landscape.

**B. It reinforces the tone of vulnerability and powerlessness that Diana experiences throughout her training. [CORRECT]**
This option correctly analyzes how the simile contributes to tone. Comparing herself to "a child caught sneaking sweets" emphasizes Diana's feelings of being small, guilty, and at the mercy of an authority figure's judgment. This reinforces the vulnerable tone established throughout the passage, where Diana describes feeling self-conscious, making mistakes, and fearing dismissal. The simile's imagery of childhood wrongdoing amplifies her sense of powerlessness in the mentor-student relationship.

**C. It establishes a bitter, resentful tone toward Dr. Blackwell's teaching methods.**
While Diana does feel the reprimand is unjust, the simile itself doesn't create bitterness or resentment. The comparison to a child suggests shame and submission rather than anger or rebellion. Diana "bit my tongue and said nothing," indicating acceptance rather than resentment. The tone is more about vulnerability and self-doubt than bitter opposition to Dr. Blackwell's methods.

**D. It develops a nostalgic tone by connecting Diana's current experiences to pleasant childhood memories.**
This option misinterprets both the simile and the emotional context. Being "caught sneaking sweets" refers to getting in trouble, not a pleasant memory. The simile evokes the shame and guilt of childhood misbehavior, not nostalgia. Additionally, the surrounding context of feeling "unjustly reprimanded" and worse after a patient's sympathetic look contradicts any nostalgic interpretation.

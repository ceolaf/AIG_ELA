1. Read this sentence from the passage:

> “It seems that the more I seek her approval, the **farther it recedes in the distance**.”

What is the *best* explanation of how the phrase “farther it recedes in the distance” affects the meaning and tone of this sentence?

A. It shows that Dr. Blackwell is physically moving away from Diana, creating a lonely and isolated mood.  
B. It suggests that Diana’s chances of gaining Dr. Blackwell’s approval feel like a distant, almost unreachable goal, adding to her frustration and doubt.*  
C. It explains that Dr. Blackwell is too busy to notice Diana, giving the scene a calm and practical tone.  
D. It indicates that Diana is literally being sent away from the clinic, creating a tone of finality and closure.

**Correct Answer: B***

---

### Rationales

**A. It shows that Dr. Blackwell is physically moving away from Diana, creating a lonely and isolated mood.**  
- This misreads the phrase literally. Nothing in the sentence describes Dr. Blackwell walking away.  
- “Approval” is an abstract idea; saying it “recedes in the distance” is figurative language, not physical movement.  
- This choice ignores the connotation that her *goal* feels farther away, not the person.

**B. It suggests that Diana’s chances of gaining Dr. Blackwell’s approval feel like a distant, almost unreachable goal, adding to her frustration and doubt.*  
- This recognizes the phrase as figurative: “approval” is treated like something moving farther away from her.  
- The connotation is that the harder she tries, the less possible success feels, which deepens her self-doubt and discouragement.  
- This directly addresses RL.8.4 by explaining how the author’s word choice shapes both meaning (her goal feels unreachable) and tone (frustrated, discouraged).

**C. It explains that Dr. Blackwell is too busy to notice Diana, giving the scene a calm and practical tone.**  
- The sentence focuses on Diana’s *feelings* about approval, not on Dr. Blackwell’s schedule or busyness.  
- The tone is not calm or practical; it is anxious and self-critical.  
- This answer invents a cause (“too busy”) that is not supported by the quoted sentence.

**D. It indicates that Diana is literally being sent away from the clinic, creating a tone of finality and closure.**  
- At this point in the passage, she *fears* being sent away, but it has not happened.  
- The phrase “recedes in the distance” modifies “approval,” not Diana’s physical location.  
- The tone is worried and ongoing, not final or resolved, so “finality and closure” misrepresents the mood.

Tier 7a (Claude) #1 (temp=0.7)

**Multiple Choice Item - RL.8.4**

In the passage, the narrator states that Dr. Blackwell's approval "recedes in the distance" as she seeks it more desperately. How does the author's use of the phrase "recedes in the distance" impact the meaning and tone of this part of the text?

A. It suggests that Dr. Blackwell is physically moving away from the narrator, creating a tone of abandonment.

B. It emphasizes that gaining approval requires patience and time, creating a tone of hopeful waiting.

C. *It conveys that the narrator's efforts are making her goal seem increasingly unattainable, creating a tone of growing desperation and frustration.

D. It indicates that the narrator's memory of wanting approval is fading, creating a tone of indifference.

**Rationales:**

**A. It suggests that Dr. Blackwell is physically moving away from the narrator, creating a tone of abandonment.**
This response focuses only on the literal, denotative meaning of "recedes in the distance" as physical movement away. It fails to recognize that the phrase is used figuratively to describe the narrator's psychological experience of her goal becoming harder to achieve. The reader misses the connotative meaning and metaphorical use of spatial language to describe an emotional/aspirational state.

**B. It emphasizes that gaining approval requires patience and time, creating a tone of hopeful waiting.**
This response mischaracterizes the emotional impact and tone created by the phrase. While it recognizes that "recedes in the distance" relates to the difficulty of obtaining approval, it incorrectly interprets this as creating hope rather than frustration. The context shows the narrator's increasing anxiety and self-doubt, not patient optimism.

**C. *It conveys that the narrator's efforts are making her goal seem increasingly unattainable, creating a tone of growing desperation and frustration.**
This is the correct answer. The phrase "recedes in the distance" uses spatial imagery figuratively to show how the narrator's goal of gaining approval seems to move further away the harder she tries. The connotative meaning suggests something slipping away despite effort, and in this context, it reinforces the tone of mounting frustration and desperation evident in the surrounding text about her repeated failures and scoldings.

**D. It indicates that the narrator's memory of wanting approval is fading, creating a tone of indifference.**
This response completely misinterprets both the meaning and tone. It suggests the narrator is losing interest in approval, when the text clearly shows her desperation to gain it. This represents a fundamental misunderstanding of how the figurative language functions in context—the approval is receding, not the narrator's desire for it.

================= NEW ITEM =================
Tier 7a (Claude) #1 (temp=0.7)

**Multiple Choice Item for RL.8.4**

In the passage, when Diana describes feeling "like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar" after Dr. Blackwell's reprimand, what is the impact of this comparison on the meaning and tone of the text?

A. It emphasizes Diana's actual guilt and wrongdoing in the situation.

B. It shows that Diana has a sweet tooth and thinks about food when nervous.

C. It reveals Diana's immaturity and inability to handle professional criticism.

*D. It conveys Diana's sense of unfair treatment and diminished dignity in a professional setting.

**Rationales:**

**Option A:** This distractor appeals to students who focus only on the surface connection between being "caught" doing something wrong and Diana being reprimand. However, this misses the connotative meaning of the comparison. Diana explicitly states she felt "unjustly reprimanded," indicating she doesn't believe she was actually guilty of wrongdoing. The comparison emphasizes the feeling of unfair treatment rather than actual guilt.

**Option B:** This distractor represents a completely literal interpretation that ignores the figurative nature of the comparison. Students choosing this option are not recognizing that "sneaking sweets from a jar" is used metaphorically to describe a feeling, not to indicate Diana's actual thoughts about food. This demonstrates a failure to move beyond denotative meaning to understand the author's word choice.

**Option C:** This distractor might appeal to students who recognize some connotative meaning in the child comparison but misinterpret its impact on tone. While the comparison does reference childhood, the context shows Diana is competent (she was "quite capable" as a field nurse) and the phrase "unjustly reprimanded" indicates the issue isn't her immaturity but rather the unfairness of the treatment.

**Option D (Correct Answer):** This option correctly identifies how the author's specific word choice creates meaning beyond the literal level. The comparison to "a child caught sneaking sweets" connotes innocence, minor transgression, and disproportionate punishment. In the context of a professional medical setting, this comparison emphasizes how Diana feels her dignity has been undermined and she's been treated unfairly, contributing to a tone that evokes sympathy for her position. The word choice transforms a simple reprimand scene into one that highlights the power dynamics and Diana's vulnerability in this professional relationship.

Tier 7a (Claude) #2 (temp=0.8)

**Multiple Choice Item for RL.8.4**

In the passage, Diana describes her hope for Dr. Blackwell's approval as something that "recedes in the distance." How does this word choice impact the meaning and tone of the text?

A. It indicates that Diana needs to improve her eyesight to see Dr. Blackwell more clearly.

*B. It transforms Diana's professional goal into something that feels increasingly unattainable and isolating.

C. It shows that Dr. Blackwell is physically moving away from Diana in the clinic.

D. It demonstrates that Diana is making steady progress toward earning respect over time.

**Rationales:**

**Option A:** This distractor represents a completely literal misinterpretation of the figurative language. Students choosing this option are focusing on the denotative meaning of "recedes in the distance" as something visual/physical rather than recognizing it as a metaphor for emotional and professional distance. This shows a failure to recognize the figurative use of the phrase.

**Option B (Correct Answer):** This option correctly identifies how the author's metaphorical language creates deeper meaning. The phrase "recedes in the distance" typically describes something moving farther away despite efforts to reach it, like a mirage or horizon. Applied to approval/respect, this word choice connotes futility and creates a tone of frustration and loneliness. It suggests that Diana's efforts are not only unsuccessful but counterproductive—the harder she tries, the more elusive her goal becomes. This transforms a simple workplace challenge into something that feels almost impossibly distant and emotionally isolating.

**Option C:** This distractor appeals to students who recognize that "recedes in the distance" involves movement and distance but apply it too literally to the physical setting. While the phrase does connote movement, students choosing this miss that it's being used metaphorically to describe the emotional/professional relationship rather than literal physical positioning in the clinic.

**Option D:** This distractor represents a misunderstanding of the connotative meaning of "recedes." Students might incorrectly think "in the distance" suggests something achievable that's simply far away, missing that "recedes" specifically means moving farther away. This creates the opposite meaning—something becoming more unattainable rather than showing progress. This option also contradicts the context where Diana describes making mistakes and receiving scoldings.

Tier 7a (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7)

1. Read the sentence from the passage.

   “Every day has brought at least one similar scolding. **It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance.**”

   In this sentence, what is the effect of the phrase “the farther it recedes in the distance” on the meaning and tone of the paragraph?

   A. It suggests that Dr. Blackwell is literally moving farther away from the narrator, creating a sense of physical separation between them.  
   B. It shows that the narrator believes Dr. Blackwell’s approval is becoming less and less likely, emphasizing her growing discouragement.*  
   C. It indicates that the narrator is losing interest in Dr. Blackwell’s approval, adding a tone of indifference.  
   D. It implies that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is being delayed for a short time, giving the paragraph a hopeful tone.

**Correct Answer: B***

---

### Rationales

**A. It suggests that Dr. Blackwell is literally moving farther away from the narrator, creating a sense of physical separation between them.**

- This misreads the figurative language as literal.  
- “The farther it recedes in the distance” is not about Dr. Blackwell physically walking away; it refers to approval becoming harder to reach.  
- Choosing this shows a misunderstanding of how the phrase is used in this text.

**B. It shows that the narrator believes Dr. Blackwell’s approval is becoming less and less likely, emphasizing her growing discouragement.*  

- The phrase compares approval to something that moves away as you move toward it.  
- This figurative use suggests that, despite the narrator’s efforts, approval feels more unreachable.  
- This deepens the tone of frustration and discouragement in the paragraph, directly aligning with RL.8.4.

**C. It indicates that the narrator is losing interest in Dr. Blackwell’s approval, adding a tone of indifference.**

- The narrator is not indifferent; she is desperate for approval (“the more I seek her approval”).  
- The tone is anxious and self-critical, not uncaring.  
- This option ignores the emotional context and mischaracterizes the tone.

**D. It implies that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is being delayed for a short time, giving the paragraph a hopeful tone.**

- “Recedes in the distance” implies something becoming less attainable, not just delayed.  
- The paragraph stresses the narrator’s fear and self-doubt, not hope.  
- This misinterprets the connotation of “recedes” and misreads the tone as optimistic.

Tier 7a (GPT) #2 (temp=0.8)

2. Read this sentence from the passage.

   “If I was hoping to find a motherly figure in Dr. Blackwell, I was quickly **disabused** of that notion.”

   How does the author’s use of the word “disabused” affect the meaning and tone of this sentence?

   A. It shows that the narrator feels gently guided toward a better understanding, creating a warm and grateful tone.  
   B. It suggests that the narrator’s mistaken hope was corrected in a firm, almost harsh way, adding a tone of disappointment and realism.*  
   C. It indicates that the narrator still believes Dr. Blackwell is secretly motherly, creating a hopeful and playful tone.  
   D. It shows that the narrator was confused by Dr. Blackwell’s behavior, giving the sentence a puzzled and uncertain tone.

**Correct Answer: B***

---

### Rationales

**A. It shows that the narrator feels gently guided toward a better understanding, creating a warm and grateful tone.**

- “Disabused” carries a connotation of being stripped of an illusion, not gently guided.  
- The context (public reprimands, “thought nothing of reprimanding me”) suggests the correction was uncomfortable, not warm.  
- This misreads both the connotation and the surrounding tone.

**B. It suggests that the narrator’s mistaken hope was corrected in a firm, almost harsh way, adding a tone of disappointment and realism.*  

- “Disabused” implies being forcefully set straight from a false belief.  
- The narrator learns that Dr. Blackwell is not “motherly” but strict and critical.  
- This choice captures the figurative impact of the word on meaning (losing an illusion) and tone (disappointed, more realistic).

**C. It indicates that the narrator still believes Dr. Blackwell is secretly motherly, creating a hopeful and playful tone.**

- “Disabused of that notion” clearly means the narrator no longer holds that belief.  
- There is no hint of secret or playful hope; the tone is sober and resigned.  
- This directly contradicts the text’s meaning.

**D. It shows that the narrator was confused by Dr. Blackwell’s behavior, giving the sentence a puzzled and uncertain tone.**

- “Disabused” does not mean confused; it means relieved of a false idea.  
- The narrator is not uncertain; she is sure that her earlier hope was wrong.  
- This reflects a misunderstanding of the word’s connotation and its impact on tone.

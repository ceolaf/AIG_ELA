### Rationales

**Option B (Correct):**  
- The phrase “sunk in despair” uses figurative language. Literally, “sunk” means to go down into something, like sinking into water.  
- Here, “sunk” suggests the boy’s despair is so heavy it pulls him down emotionally, emphasizing how intense and overwhelming his sadness is.  
- This word choice darkens the tone of the moment, making it feel heavy and serious rather than mildly sad.  

**Option A (Distractor):**  
- “Calm and peaceful” misreads the connotation of “sunk in despair.”  
- Despair is a strong negative emotion, not acceptance or peace.  
- A student choosing this is likely focusing only on the idea of “sunk” as being still or settled, without considering the strong negative tone of “despair.”  

**Option C (Distractor):**  
- Nothing in “sunk in despair” suggests anger or being “ready to fight.”  
- “Despair” connotes hopelessness and deep sadness, the opposite of active anger.  
- This reflects a misunderstanding of the denotative and connotative meaning of “despair,” confusing it with frustration or rage.  

**Option D (Distractor):**  
- “Confused and uncertain” does not match the phrase.  
- The boy knows exactly what happened: his kitten is stuck on the pole and might freeze.  
- “Sunk in despair” shows a clear emotional state (hopeless sadness), not confusion.  
- A student choosing this may be giving a generic emotional description instead of one rooted in the specific wording and context.

2. In the description, the town of Hanover is described as “anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland” and its buildings are said to be “huddled on the gray prairie, under a gray sky.” How do these word choices (“anchored” and “huddled”) work together to shape the tone of the setting?

A. They make the town seem cheerful and welcoming, as if everyone is safely gathered together.  
B. They make the town seem powerful and secure, firmly holding its place against nature.  
C. They make the town seem small and vulnerable, clinging to the land against the harsh wind.*  
D. They make the town seem busy and crowded, full of energy and constant activity.

**Correct Answer: C***

### Rationales

**Option C (Correct):**  
- “Anchored” usually describes a ship held in place so it won’t drift away; here it suggests the town is being held down so it won’t be “blown away” by the wind.  
- “Huddled” often describes people crowding together for warmth or protection, not comfort.  
- Together, these words imply the town is fragile and exposed, needing to cling to the land, which creates a tone of vulnerability and struggle against the harsh environment.

**Option A (Distractor):**  
- While “huddled” can sometimes suggest warmth or closeness, in this context it appears with “windy,” “gray prairie,” and “gray sky,” which are bleak details.  
- The overall tone is not cheerful or welcoming but cold and harsh.  
- This choice ignores the negative connotations created by the surrounding description.

**Option B (Distractor):**  
- “Anchored” might suggest stability, but here it is “anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland” and “trying not to be blown away,” which undercuts any sense of power.  
- The town is resisting the wind, not dominating it.  
- This misreads “anchored” as purely strong and secure, without considering the struggle implied by the context.

**Option D (Distractor):**  
- Nothing in “anchored” or “huddled” suggests busyness or energy.  
- The passage emphasizes emptiness and stillness: the children are in school, shopkeepers stay behind windows, the street is nearly empty.  
- This answer projects an idea of “crowded” or “full of activity” that is not supported by the text or the specific word choices.

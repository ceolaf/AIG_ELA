1. In paragraph 1, the town of Hanover is described as being “anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland” and “trying not to be blown away.” What is the most accurate way to describe the effect of the word “anchored” in this description?

A. It literally explains that the town is held down by heavy equipment so the wind cannot move it.  
B. It suggests that the town feels firmly secure and safe, creating a calm, peaceful tone.  
*C. It figuratively compares the town to a ship held in place, emphasizing how the fierce wind makes its existence feel shaky and temporary.*  
D. It shows that the town is stuck in one place because the people are too lazy to move, creating a mocking tone.

---

Rationales:

A. This treats “anchored” as purely literal, ignoring the figurative use. There is no mention of actual equipment; instead, the sentence personifies the town as “trying not to be blown away,” so this misses the connotative meaning and impact on tone.

B. “Anchored” can sometimes suggest security, but here it contrasts with “trying not to be blown away” and the later details (“None of them had any appearance of permanence”). The tone is uneasy and exposed, not calm and peaceful, so this misreads the word’s effect in context.

C. This is correct. “Anchored” alludes to a ship held in place, but the town still seems at risk of being “blown away.” The figurative comparison highlights the power of the wind and the town’s fragile hold on the land, supporting the passage’s tone of instability and impermanence.

D. This invents a meaning not supported by the text. Nothing suggests laziness or mockery; the focus is on the environment’s harshness, not on the characters’ motivation. This projects an impact on tone that does not come from the word “anchored” or the surrounding description.

Tier 7b (GPT) #2 (temp=0.8)

2. In paragraph 1, the buildings are described as “huddled on the gray prairie, under a gray sky.” How does the word “huddled” affect the meaning and tone of this description?

A. It shows that the buildings are carefully organized in neat, even rows, creating an orderly tone.  
B. It suggests the buildings are crowded together because there is not enough land, creating a cramped tone.  
*C. It figuratively makes the buildings seem like frightened people pressed together for protection, emphasizing the town’s vulnerability to the harsh landscape.*  
D. It literally means the buildings are falling down on top of each other, creating a chaotic, destructive tone.

---

Rationales:

A. This ignores both the literal and figurative sense of “huddled.” The passage says buildings are “set about haphazard” and “straggled,” the opposite of neat order, so this misreads the context and tone.

B. While “huddled” can suggest closeness, the text does not mention a lack of land; it’s on a wide “tableland” and “open plain.” This projects a cramped feeling that does not come from the passage.

C. This is correct. “Huddled” is a figurative word choice that makes the buildings seem like people bunching together for safety. Combined with the wind and grayness, it underscores the town’s smallness and exposure, contributing to a vulnerable, uneasy tone.

D. This treats “huddled” as if it meant literal collapse. Nothing in the text suggests the buildings are falling down; instead, they merely lack “appearance of permanence.” This misinterprets the word and exaggerates the situation beyond what the passage describes.

### Rationales

**A. Dr. Blackwell is physically moving farther away from Diana each day.**  
- Misinterprets the figurative language as literal.  
- The sentence is about “approval,” not physical distance, so this does not fit the context.

**B. Diana feels that earning Dr. Blackwell’s approval is becoming less and less likely over time.*  
- Correct.  
- “The farther it recedes in the distance” is a metaphor comparing Dr. Blackwell’s approval to something that keeps moving away as Diana moves toward it.  
- This figurative language shows that, although Diana tries harder, she feels less likely to gain approval, which adds to the discouraged tone.

**C. Dr. Blackwell is starting to forget who Diana is and what she has done.**  
- Not supported by the passage; Dr. Blackwell clearly notices Diana and corrects her.  
- Confuses “approval” with memory, which is not suggested by the text.

**D. Diana is spending less time trying to impress Dr. Blackwell.**  
- Contradicts the passage; Diana says “the more I seek her approval,” showing she is trying more, not less.  
- Misreads the cause-and-effect relationship in the sentence.

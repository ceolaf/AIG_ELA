1. Which of the following best explains how the word “anchored” in the phrase “the little town of Hanover, anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland” contributes to the tone of the opening paragraph?

A. It suggests that the town is a safe and peaceful harbor, protected from the harsh weather.  
*B. It implies that the town is barely holding its place against powerful forces that might carry it away.*  
C. It shows that the town is wealthy and firmly established in the region.  
D. It indicates that the town is literally tied to the railroad tracks that run through it.  

**Rationales**

- **A. It suggests that the town is a safe and peaceful harbor, protected from the harsh weather.**  
  This misreads the connotation. While “anchored” can suggest safety in some contexts, the rest of the paragraph (“trying not to be blown away,” “howling wind,” “no appearance of permanence”) emphasizes vulnerability, not safety or peace. This answer ignores how the surrounding details shape the word’s effect.

- **B. It implies that the town is barely holding its place against powerful forces that might carry it away.***  
  This is correct. “Anchored” is used figuratively: the town is not literally tied down, but is clinging to the land like a ship in a storm. Combined with “trying not to be blown away,” the word choice creates a tense, precarious tone, suggesting the town is struggling to remain where it is.

- **C. It shows that the town is wealthy and firmly established in the region.**  
  “Anchored” does not convey wealth, and the passage explicitly undercuts the idea of being firmly established: the buildings “had no appearance of permanence” and looked as if they might “stray off.” This answer confuses “anchored” with “prosperous” or “secure,” which the text does not support.

- **D. It indicates that the town is literally tied to the railroad tracks that run through it.**  
  This takes the figurative word literally. The sentence does mention the railway station later, but “anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland” refers to the town’s position on the land, not to any physical ropes or ties to the tracks. This misinterprets the non-literal use of “anchored.”

2. In the description of the town, the narrator says that some houses looked “as if they had been moved in overnight, and others as if they were straying off by themselves, headed straight for the open plain.” How does this figurative language affect the tone of the passage?

A. It makes the town seem lively and full of energy, as if the houses are joyfully exploring.  
B. It makes the town seem orderly and carefully planned, with buildings placed exactly where they belong.  
*C. It makes the town seem unstable and temporary, as if it could easily fall apart or disappear.*  
D. It makes the town seem abandoned and completely empty, with no people living in it at all.  

**Rationales**

- **A. It makes the town seem lively and full of energy, as if the houses are joyfully exploring.**  
  This misreads the connotation. While the houses are described as if they are moving, the larger context (“trying not to be blown away,” “no appearance of permanence”) suggests insecurity, not joyful energy. This answer ignores the uneasy, wind-battered setting.

- **B. It makes the town seem orderly and carefully planned, with buildings placed exactly where they belong.**  
  This is the opposite of the passage’s description. The houses are “set about haphazard,” and some seem to be “straying off.” The figurative language emphasizes disorder, not careful planning, so this interpretation is not supported by the text.

- **C. It makes the town seem unstable and temporary, as if it could easily fall apart or disappear.***  
  This is correct. Describing houses as if they were “moved in overnight” or “straying off” personifies them and suggests they are not firmly fixed in place. Combined with “none of them had any appearance of permanence,” this word choice creates a tone of fragility and uncertainty.

- **D. It makes the town seem abandoned and completely empty, with no people living in it at all.**  
  The passage clearly mentions people (shopkeepers, countrymen, children in school), so the town is not empty. The figurative language is about the houses’ apparent motion and lack of permanence, not about total abandonment. This answer overstates the effect and contradicts details in the text.

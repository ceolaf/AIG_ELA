### Correct Answer: B*

**Rationales**

**A. Her approval is slowly becoming less important to the narrator.**  
- Misinterpretation of the figurative language.  
- “Recedes in the distance” suggests the approval is harder to reach, not that it matters less.  
- The narrator’s tone shows that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is very important to her, not “less important.”

**B. Her approval is moving farther away no matter how hard the narrator tries to earn it.*  
- Correct.  
- “Recedes in the distance” is used figuratively to compare approval to something the narrator is chasing that keeps moving away.  
- This captures both the literal image (something getting farther away) and the connotation of frustration and discouragement, which contributes to the tone of self-doubt.

**C. Her approval is hidden from view because Dr. Blackwell is rarely around.**  
- Incorrect because it treats the phrase too literally.  
- The passage shows Dr. Blackwell is very present (“under her watchful eye”), so the issue is not her absence.  
- The phrase is about emotional distance, not physical visibility.

**D. Her approval is guaranteed, but the narrator must simply be patient.**  
- Opposite of the intended meaning.  
- “Recedes in the distance” suggests the goal is becoming less attainable, not guaranteed.  
- The narrator fears being sent away, which shows she does not feel assured of gaining approval.

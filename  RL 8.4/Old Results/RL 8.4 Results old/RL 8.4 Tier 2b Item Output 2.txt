1. Which of the following best explains how the narrator’s comparison “like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar” affects the meaning and tone of the paragraph?

A. It emphasizes that Dr. Blackwell treats the narrator as if she were much younger and less experienced than she really is, creating a tone of resentment.  
B. It shows that the narrator feels foolish and guilty after being scolded, creating a tone of embarrassment and self-doubt.*  
C. It suggests that the narrator has actually been behaving in a childish way at the clinic, creating a tone of playful humor.  
D. It reveals that the narrator misses the simpler days of her childhood, creating a tone of nostalgia.

**Rationales**

- **Option B (Key)*:**  
  - The simile appears after Dr. Blackwell snaps, “Less chatter, please, Diana!” and the narrator says, “Once again, I felt unjustly reprimanded, like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar.”  
  - The image of a child sneaking sweets suggests feeling guilty and being caught doing something wrong, even if it seems small.  
  - The phrase “unjustly reprimanded” plus the comparison show that she feels foolish, ashamed, and small, which supports a tone of embarrassment and self-doubt rather than anger or humor.  

- **Option A (Distractor):**  
  - A reader might notice that the narrator feels “unjustly reprimanded” and infer tension with Dr. Blackwell.  
  - However, the simile focuses on how the narrator feels (guilty, caught, childish), not on how Dr. Blackwell actually views her.  
  - The tone in the sentence is more self-conscious and embarrassed than resentful, so this misreads the emotional impact.  

- **Option C (Distractor):**  
  - The image of “sneaking sweets from a jar” might seem lighthearted to some readers, leading them to think it creates humor.  
  - But the surrounding words—“snapped,” “unjustly reprimanded,” “bit my tongue”—are serious and negative in tone.  
  - There is no signal that the narrator finds the situation playful; instead, she feels hurt and ashamed, so this misinterprets the tone.  

- **Option D (Distractor):**  
  - The mention of a “child” might tempt readers to connect it to childhood memories or nostalgia.  
  - However, the comparison is about how she feels in the moment (small and caught doing wrong), not about longing for the past.  
  - Nothing in the paragraph suggests she is reminiscing about “simpler days,” so this adds a meaning not supported by the text.

### Rationales

**A. Literally dropped down to sit on the ground**  
This choice takes “sunk” too literally, as if it only means physically sitting or dropping down. While the boy is sitting, the text focuses on his emotional state: “Her master was sunk in despair.” The word “despair” is an emotion, so “sunk” here is used figuratively to describe how deeply he feels that emotion, not his physical position.

**B. Gradually lowered into the snow**  
This suggests a physical image of someone sinking into snow, which does not match the context. The sentence does not mention snow around the boy at that moment; instead, it describes his feelings about the kitten. The pairing of “sunk” with “despair” signals that the author is using “sunk” figuratively, not to describe a physical action.

**C. Overwhelmed or weighed down by sadness**  
This best captures the figurative meaning. The phrase “sunk in despair” suggests that the boy is so deeply unhappy that the feeling seems to pull him down, as if he is submerged in it. The strong emotional words around it (“crying bitterly,” “too unhappy to care”) support this connotative meaning and help create a tone of deep sadness and helplessness.

**D. Forced to think carefully about a problem**  
This meaning might fit a phrase like “sunk in thought,” but the text says “sunk in despair,” which is about emotion, not thinking. The boy is not shown carefully analyzing anything; instead, he is overwhelmed by worry and grief over his kitten.

### Rationales

**A. It suggests the town is literally tied down with ropes or chains.**  
This takes “anchored” in its most literal sense, as with a ship. However, the town is not actually tied down; the phrase is figurative. The author uses “anchored” to describe how the town seems to cling to the land in the strong wind, not to show real ropes or chains.

**B. It shows the town is firmly fixed in place despite the powerful wind.***  
This captures the figurative and connotative meaning. “Anchored” suggests stability and resistance, as if the town is holding on against the storm. This word choice emphasizes how fierce the wind is (the town seems like it might blow away) and creates a tone of struggle and determination.

**C. It means the town is slowly sinking into the prairie soil.**  
“Anchored” does not suggest sinking; it suggests being held in place. The rest of the description (“windy Nebraska tableland,” “trying not to be blown away”) focuses on the force of the wind, not on the town going down into the ground, so this interpretation does not fit the context.

**D. It hints that the town is moving away from the railroad station.**  
Nothing in the sentence implies movement away from the station. Instead, “anchored” has the opposite effect: it suggests the town is staying put. The tension in the sentence is between the strong wind and the town’s effort to remain in place, not between the town and the railroad.

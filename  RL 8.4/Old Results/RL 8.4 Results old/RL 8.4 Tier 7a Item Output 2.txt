1. Read this sentence from the passage:

   “Every day has brought at least one similar scolding. **It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance.**”

   What is the effect of the phrase “the farther it recedes in the distance” on the meaning and tone of this sentence?

   A. It shows that Dr. Blackwell has literally moved away from the narrator, creating a sense of physical separation.  
   B. It suggests that the narrator’s goal of earning Dr. Blackwell’s approval feels like something she is chasing but can never quite reach.*  
   C. It explains that the narrator has stopped trying to impress Dr. Blackwell, giving the sentence a calm, accepting tone.  
   D. It indicates that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is unimportant to the narrator, adding a careless, dismissive tone.

**Correct Answer: B***

**Rationales**

- **A. It shows that Dr. Blackwell has literally moved away from the narrator, creating a sense of physical separation.**  
  This misreads the phrase as literal. “Recedes in the distance” is used figuratively here; Dr. Blackwell is still physically present, even “at my elbow” later. The phrase instead describes how approval feels harder to attain, not actual movement.

- **B. It suggests that the narrator’s goal of earning Dr. Blackwell’s approval feels like something she is chasing but can never quite reach.*  
  This correctly interprets “recedes in the distance” as figurative language. The approval is compared to something that keeps moving away as she moves toward it, emphasizing her frustration and discouragement and shaping a tone of growing hopelessness.

- **C. It explains that the narrator has stopped trying to impress Dr. Blackwell, giving the sentence a calm, accepting tone.**  
  This contradicts the passage. The narrator continues to “seek her approval,” and the tone is anxious and discouraged, not calm or accepting. The phrase intensifies her struggle, rather than showing that she has given up.

- **D. It indicates that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is unimportant to the narrator, adding a careless, dismissive tone.**  
  This ignores the context. The narrator’s hopes “would be extinguished” if she is sent away, so Dr. Blackwell’s approval is extremely important. The tone is not careless; the figurative phrase underscores her worry that the approval she desperately wants keeps slipping away.

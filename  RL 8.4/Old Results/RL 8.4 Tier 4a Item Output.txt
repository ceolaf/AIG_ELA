**Correct Answer: B***

---

### Rationales

**A. Her approval is literally moving away from the narrator as she walks through the clinic.**  
- This takes the phrase too literally.  
- “Recedes in the distance” is figurative; it does not describe physical movement through space.  
- A student choosing this is not recognizing the non-literal, connotative meaning.

**B. The harder the narrator tries to impress Dr. Blackwell, the more impossible earning her approval seems.***  
- “Recedes in the distance” suggests something that seems to move farther away the closer you try to get—like a mirage.  
- In context, the narrator says, “It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance,” showing a cause-and-effect: her effort increases, but success feels less attainable.  
- This captures the figurative meaning and shows how the word choice emphasizes her frustration and discouragement.

**C. Dr. Blackwell is intentionally hiding her approval so that no one can ever earn it.**  
- The sentence does not say Dr. Blackwell is deliberately hiding her approval.  
- The phrase describes how approval feels to the narrator, not Dr. Blackwell’s intentions.  
- This option misreads tone and adds motives not supported by the text.

**D. The narrator believes Dr. Blackwell has already decided never to approve of any woman doctor.**  
- The narrator hopes to gain Dr. Blackwell’s respect and later does receive praise, so she does not believe approval is impossible for all women.  
- “Recedes in the distance” conveys difficulty and discouragement, not a permanent, absolute refusal.  
- This overstates the meaning and conflicts with the ending of the passage, where Dr. Blackwell smiles and praises her.

Tier 4a (Claude) #1 (temp=0.7)

Here is a multiple choice item aligned to RL.8.4 using the provided passage:

**Item:**

In the passage, the narrator states that Dr. Blackwell's approval "recedes in the distance" as she seeks it more desperately. What is the impact of the author's word choice in this phrase?

A. It suggests that the narrator is physically moving away from Dr. Blackwell in the clinic.

B. It implies that the narrator's eyesight is failing due to stress and exhaustion.

C. It indicates that Dr. Blackwell is deliberately avoiding the narrator during work hours.

*D. It emphasizes how the narrator's anxiety makes her goal feel increasingly unattainable.

**Rationales:**

**Option A:** This response focuses only on the literal, denotative meaning of "recedes in the distance" as physical movement or space. A student choosing this option is not recognizing the figurative use of the phrase and is interpreting it too literally, missing the emotional and psychological meaning the author intends.

**Option B:** This response attempts to find a literal medical explanation for the visual imagery in "recedes in the distance." While the student recognizes that something is wrong with the narrator's perception, they are not grasping the figurative nature of the language and how it represents the narrator's emotional state rather than a physical condition.

**Option C:** This response misinterprets the phrase by focusing on Dr. Blackwell's actions rather than the narrator's internal experience. The student is not recognizing that "recedes in the distance" is figurative language describing the narrator's perception of her goal, not describing Dr. Blackwell's literal behavior.

**Option D (Correct Answer):** This response demonstrates understanding of the figurative meaning of "recedes in the distance." The phrase uses spatial imagery to convey the emotional concept that the more desperately the narrator tries to gain approval, the more impossible and distant that goal seems to become. The word choice creates a tone of frustration and desperation, showing how the narrator's anxiety is self-defeating and makes her dream feel increasingly out of reach.

**Multiple Choice Item for RL.8.4**

In the passage, when Diana describes feeling "like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar" after being reprimanded by Dr. Blackwell, this comparison reveals that Diana feels:

A. guilty about taking something that doesn't belong to her
B. nostalgic for simpler times from her childhood
C. angry that she is being treated unfairly by an authority figure
*D. ashamed and caught doing something wrong, even though she believes her actions were justified

**Rationales:**

**Option A Rationale:** This response focuses too literally on the denotative meaning of "sneaking sweets." A student choosing this option is likely interpreting the comparison at face value, thinking about actual theft or taking something that belongs to someone else. However, Diana isn't literally taking anything; this misses the figurative meaning of the comparison and how it relates to her emotional state in the medical situation.

**Option B Rationale:** This response misinterprets the emotional tone of the comparison. While the analogy does reference childhood, it's not meant to evoke nostalgia or longing for the past. A student selecting this option may recognize that childhood is referenced but fails to understand that the comparison is about the feeling of being caught and reprimanded, not about missing childhood experiences.

**Option C Rationale:** This response partially captures Diana's emotional state but misses a crucial element. While Diana does feel the reprimand is unjust (the text states "I felt unjustly reprimanded"), this option doesn't capture the shame and sense of wrongdoing that the specific analogy conveys. The comparison to a child caught sneaking sweets emphasizes the feeling of shame and being caught, not just anger at unfair treatment.

***Option D Rationale (Correct Answer):** This response correctly identifies the complex emotional state the analogy conveys. The comparison to "a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar" captures both the shame of being caught doing something perceived as wrong and the internal conflict Diana feels because she believes her compassionate actions toward the patient were appropriate. The analogy effectively shows how Diana feels diminished and ashamed under Dr. Blackwell's criticism, even though she knows her intentions were good. This demonstrates understanding of how the author's specific word choice creates meaning beyond the literal level.

Tier 4a (Claude) #2 (temp=0.8)

**Multiple Choice Item for RL.8.4**

In the passage, Diana describes Dr. Blackwell's approval as something that "recedes in the distance" as she seeks it more desperately. This phrase suggests that:

A. Dr. Blackwell is physically moving away from Diana during their interactions
*B. the harder Diana tries to earn respect, the more impossible it becomes to achieve
C. Diana needs to look farther ahead into the future to find success
D. Dr. Blackwell's standards are becoming more difficult over time

**Rationales:**

**Option A Rationale:** This response interprets the phrase too literally, focusing on the denotative meaning of "recedes in the distance" as physical movement or spatial relationships. A student choosing this option is missing the figurative nature of the language and how it describes an emotional/psychological experience rather than actual physical distance. The phrase is used metaphorically to describe Diana's relationship with gaining approval, not Dr. Blackwell's literal position.

***Option B Rationale (Correct Answer):** This response correctly identifies the figurative meaning of the phrase and its impact on the text's meaning. The image of something "receding in the distance" creates a sense of futility and frustration—the more one chases after it, the farther away it gets, like a mirage. This metaphor effectively captures Diana's psychological state and the counterproductive nature of her desperate attempts to please Dr. Blackwell. The word choice creates tension and emphasizes how Diana's anxiety is actually working against her goal, adding depth to the characterization and conflict.

**Option C Rationale:** This response misinterprets the temporal aspect of the metaphor. While "distance" can sometimes relate to future time, in this context the phrase is about the impossibility of achieving something in the present moment, not about looking toward future success. A student selecting this option may be trying to connect "distance" with time but fails to understand how the metaphor functions to show Diana's current frustration and the self-defeating nature of her efforts.

**Option D Rationale:** This response misses the key insight that the metaphor reveals about Diana's own behavior being part of the problem. While it's possible that standards could become more difficult, the phrase specifically connects the receding approval to Diana's increased seeking ("the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes"). The metaphor isn't about changing standards but about how Diana's desperate attempts are counterproductive. This option fails to recognize the cause-and-effect relationship the figurative language establishes.

================= NEW ITEM =================
Tier 4a (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7)

1. Read this sentence from the passage:

   “It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance.”

   As it is used in this sentence, what is the most accurate meaning of the phrase “the farther it recedes in the distance”?

   A. Dr. Blackwell is moving physically farther away from the narrator.  
   B. The narrator feels that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is becoming less and less likely to be earned.*  
   C. The narrator is deciding she no longer wants Dr. Blackwell’s approval.  
   D. Dr. Blackwell is forgetting about the narrator and her mistakes.

---

**Correct Answer: B***

**Rationales**

- **A. Dr. Blackwell is moving physically farther away from the narrator.**  
  This takes “recedes in the distance” literally, as if Dr. Blackwell is walking away. In context, the sentence is about “approval,” an abstract idea, so the phrase is figurative, not physical.

- **B. The narrator feels that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is becoming less and less likely to be earned.*  
  “Approval” is treated like something the narrator is chasing but that keeps moving away. The figurative phrase “the farther it recedes in the distance” suggests that each time she tries, approval seems harder to reach. This best fits the narrator’s frustration and self-doubt in the paragraph.

- **C. The narrator is deciding she no longer wants Dr. Blackwell’s approval.**  
  Nothing in the passage shows the narrator giving up on wanting approval; in fact, she says she must “gain the doctor’s respect” or be sent away. The phrase describes her difficulty achieving approval, not a change in her desire for it.

- **D. Dr. Blackwell is forgetting about the narrator and her mistakes.**  
  The passage shows the opposite: Dr. Blackwell notices and reprimands the narrator often. “Recedes in the distance” does not mean “forgetting”; it suggests that approval feels more out of reach the more the narrator tries to earn it.

2. Read this sentence from the passage:

   “If I was hoping to find a motherly figure in Dr. Blackwell, I was quickly disabused of that notion.”

   In this sentence, what is the impact of the phrase “motherly figure” on the tone of the narrator’s description of Dr. Blackwell?

   A. It creates a disappointed tone by showing that the narrator had hoped Dr. Blackwell would be gentle and comforting, but she is not.*  
   B. It creates a fearful tone by suggesting that Dr. Blackwell is as strict and frightening as the narrator’s own mother.  
   C. It creates a humorous tone by exaggerating the idea that a famous doctor could ever act like a parent.  
   D. It creates an angry tone by blaming Dr. Blackwell for refusing to care about her students’ feelings.

---

**Correct Answer: A***

**Rationales**

- **A. It creates a disappointed tone by showing that the narrator had hoped Dr. Blackwell would be gentle and comforting, but she is not.*  
  “Motherly figure” connotes warmth, protection, and kindness. By saying she was “quickly disabused of that notion,” the narrator reveals that this expectation was false. The contrast between her hope and reality gives the passage a disappointed, slightly wistful tone.

- **B. It creates a fearful tone by suggesting that Dr. Blackwell is as strict and frightening as the narrator’s own mother.**  
  The text never suggests the narrator fears Dr. Blackwell the way one might fear a harsh parent, nor does it mention the narrator’s own mother’s personality. The tone is more about let-down expectations than fear.

- **C. It creates a humorous tone by exaggerating the idea that a famous doctor could ever act like a parent.**  
  The narrator is serious and respectful; she admires Dr. Blackwell and earnestly hopes to become a doctor. There is no exaggeration or joking here, so the tone is not humorous.

- **D. It creates an angry tone by blaming Dr. Blackwell for refusing to care about her students’ feelings.**  
  The narrator does feel hurt, but she does not express anger or blame. Instead, she focuses on her own performance and desire for respect. The word choice suggests disappointment rather than outright anger.

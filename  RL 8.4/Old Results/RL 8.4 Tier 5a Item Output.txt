1. Read the sentence from the passage.

> “It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it **recedes** in the distance.”

As it is used in this sentence, what does the word “recedes” most strongly suggest about the narrator’s feelings?

A. She believes Dr. Blackwell’s approval is gradually becoming less important to her.  
B. She feels that Dr. Blackwell’s approval keeps moving away no matter how hard she tries.*  
C. She thinks Dr. Blackwell’s approval is being shared with more and more students.  
D. She is certain Dr. Blackwell’s approval will come closer if she simply waits.

---

### Rationales

**Correct Answer: B. She feels that Dr. Blackwell’s approval keeps moving away no matter how hard she tries.*  
- “Recedes in the distance” literally means “moves farther away.”  
- In context, the narrator says, “the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes,” which conveys that as she tries harder, Dr. Blackwell’s approval seems less attainable.  
- This figurative use suggests frustration and discouragement: her goal seems to keep slipping away.

**A. She believes Dr. Blackwell’s approval is gradually becoming less important to her.**  
- This reverses the meaning. “Recedes” here does not describe the narrator’s feelings about approval; it describes the approval moving away from her.  
- The passage shows she cares deeply about gaining respect (“I must somehow manage to do better…or she will send me away”), so approval is not becoming less important.

**C. She thinks Dr. Blackwell’s approval is being shared with more and more students.**  
- Nothing in “recedes in the distance” suggests sharing or dividing approval among others.  
- The phrase focuses on distance and difficulty of reaching the goal, not on competition with other students.

**D. She is certain Dr. Blackwell’s approval will come closer if she simply waits.**  
- “Recedes” implies the opposite of coming closer; it suggests moving away.  
- The narrator is not confident; she fears being sent away and feels “I could do nothing right,” so the idea of certainty and patience does not fit the tone or meaning of the sentence.

Tier 5a (Claude) #1 (temp=0.7)

Looking at this passage and the RL.8.4 standard, I'll focus on a word that carries connotative meaning and impacts tone in a way that goes beyond its literal definition.

**Multiple Choice Item:**

In the passage, when Diana describes feeling "like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar" after being reprimanded, the word "sneaking" most effectively conveys—

A. Diana's actual dishonest behavior in the medical setting
B. Diana's sense of shame and guilt despite doing nothing truly wrong  
*C. Diana's feeling of being unfairly treated like someone caught in a deliberate wrongdoing
D. Diana's childish inability to follow proper hospital procedures

**Rationales:**

**Option A:** This focuses only on the literal/denotative meaning of "sneaking" (acting dishonestly or secretly). A student choosing this option misses that Diana wasn't actually being dishonest—she was trying to comfort a patient. This interpretation doesn't recognize the figurative use of the word in the analogy.

**Option B:** This captures part of the connotative meaning (shame and guilt) but misses the key point about fairness. While Diana does feel shame, the word "sneaking" specifically suggests deliberate wrongdoing, which makes her feel the reprimand is unjust since she was actually helping a patient.

**Option C (KEY):** This recognizes the full connotative impact of "sneaking" in this context. The word carries implications of deliberate, secretive wrongdoing, which makes Diana feel she's being treated as if she committed an intentional offense when she was actually performing appropriate patient care. The word choice emphasizes the unfairness of the situation and contributes to the frustrated, unjustly-treated tone.

**Option D:** This interpretation focuses too much on the "child" part of the analogy rather than analyzing the specific impact of "sneaking." It also suggests Diana actually lacks ability, when the text shows she is competent—just nervous under observation.

The word "sneaking" goes beyond its literal meaning to convey Diana's sense of injustice—she feels accused of deliberate wrongdoing when she was actually providing compassionate care, which intensifies the tone of frustration and unfair treatment in this section of the passage.

================= NEW ITEM =================
Tier 5a (Claude) #1 (temp=0.7)

Based on the passage and RL.8.4 standard, here is a multiple choice item:

**Item:**

In the passage, the narrator states that Dr. Blackwell's approval "recedes in the distance" as she seeks it. What does the phrase "recedes in the distance" suggest about the narrator's relationship with her mentor?

A. The narrator is physically moving farther away from Dr. Blackwell each day.

B. The narrator's memory of Dr. Blackwell's previous compliments is fading over time.

*C. The narrator feels that earning Dr. Blackwell's respect is becoming increasingly difficult and unlikely.

D. The narrator believes Dr. Blackwell is deliberately avoiding spending time with her.

**Rationales:**

**Option A:** This response focuses only on the literal, denotative meaning of "recedes in the distance" as a physical description of movement or space. A student selecting this option misses the figurative use of the phrase and interprets it as describing actual physical distance rather than the metaphorical distance between the narrator and her goal of earning approval.

**Option B:** This response shows some recognition that the phrase is not literal, but misinterprets what is receding. The student understands something is fading or becoming less accessible over time, but incorrectly identifies it as memories rather than the goal of earning approval. This shows partial understanding of figurative language but misses the specific connotative meaning in context.

**Option C (Key):** This response demonstrates full understanding of the figurative and connotative meaning of "recedes in the distance." The student recognizes that the phrase creates a metaphor comparing Dr. Blackwell's approval to something that moves farther away as one tries to reach it, suggesting increasing difficulty and diminishing hope. This interpretation aligns with the narrator's growing frustration and self-doubt described throughout the passage.

**Option D:** This response misinterprets the figurative language by focusing on Dr. Blackwell's actions rather than the narrator's perception of achieving her goal. While it moves beyond literal interpretation, it incorrectly suggests the phrase describes Dr. Blackwell's deliberate behavior rather than the narrator's experience of her goal becoming more elusive.

Tier 5a (Claude) #2 (temp=0.8)

Based on the passage and RL.8.4 standard, here is another multiple choice item:

**Item:**

When the narrator describes feeling "like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar" after being reprimanded by Dr. Blackwell, what does this comparison reveal about the narrator's emotional state?

A. The narrator is hungry and thinking about food during her work shift.

B. The narrator feels guilty because she has been dishonest with Dr. Blackwell.

*C. The narrator feels both ashamed and unfairly treated, like someone punished for a minor wrongdoing.

D. The narrator believes she is too young and inexperienced to work in the medical field.

**Rationales:**

**Option A:** This response demonstrates a literal interpretation of the analogy, focusing on the denotative meaning of "sweets" rather than understanding the figurative comparison. A student selecting this option misses the metaphorical nature of the phrase and instead interprets it as the narrator's actual thoughts about food, showing no recognition of the connotative meaning.

**Option B:** This response shows partial understanding that the analogy relates to feelings of guilt, but misinterprets the specific nature of that guilt. The student recognizes some figurative meaning but incorrectly assumes the narrator has actually been dishonest, rather than understanding that she feels unjustly accused of wrongdoing when she was trying to comfort a patient.

**Option C (Key):** This response demonstrates full comprehension of the analogy's figurative and connotative meaning. The student understands that being "caught sneaking sweets" evokes the dual emotions of shame (from being caught doing something wrong) and indignation (because sneaking sweets is a relatively innocent act that doesn't warrant harsh punishment). This perfectly captures the narrator's conflicted feelings about Dr. Blackwell's reprimand for what she considers compassionate patient care.

**Option D:** This response misinterprets the analogy by focusing on the "child" aspect and drawing incorrect conclusions about age and experience. While the student recognizes some figurative meaning in the comparison to a child, they miss the specific connotative significance of the "sneaking sweets" scenario and its implications about the nature of the perceived transgression and resulting emotions.

================= NEW ITEM =================
Tier 5a (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7)

1. Read this sentence from the passage:

> “It seems that the more I seek her approval, the **farther it recedes in the distance**.”

What is the best interpretation of the phrase “farther it recedes in the distance” as it is used in this sentence?

A. The narrator feels that Dr. Blackwell is physically moving away from her.  
*B. The narrator feels that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is becoming harder and harder for her to earn.*  
C. The narrator is worried that Dr. Blackwell will move the clinic to a different city.  
D. The narrator believes that Dr. Blackwell is slowly forgetting who she is.

**Correct Answer: B***

---

### Rationales

**A. The narrator feels that Dr. Blackwell is physically moving away from her.**  
This misinterprets the figurative language as literal. “Approval” is not a physical object that can move away. The sentence uses distance metaphorically to describe how emotionally or personally out of reach Dr. Blackwell’s approval feels, not where Dr. Blackwell’s body is.

**B. The narrator feels that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is becoming harder and harder for her to earn.***  
This is correct. The phrase “farther it recedes in the distance” figuratively compares Dr. Blackwell’s approval to something the narrator is chasing but that keeps moving away. The more she tries to gain approval, the less achievable it seems. This captures both the meaning and the discouraged tone.

**C. The narrator is worried that Dr. Blackwell will move the clinic to a different city.**  
This confuses “recedes in the distance” with a change of physical location. The text around the sentence is about the narrator’s feelings about her own performance and Dr. Blackwell’s reactions, not about moving the clinic. There is no evidence of a fear that the clinic will relocate.

**D. The narrator believes that Dr. Blackwell is slowly forgetting who she is.**  
While this answer suggests a kind of emotional distance, it does not match the focus on “approval.” The narrator is concerned that she cannot earn respect, not that she is being forgotten. The metaphor emphasizes how unreachable the approval feels, not memory loss.

Tier 5a (GPT) #2 (temp=0.8)

2. Read this sentence from the passage:

> “Every day has brought at least one similar scolding. It seems that the more I seek her approval, the **farther it recedes in the distance**.”

How does the author’s use of the word **“recedes”** impact the tone of this sentence?

A. It creates an excited tone by suggesting that the narrator is quickly approaching her goal.  
B. It creates a hopeful tone by showing that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is getting closer over time.  
*C. It creates a discouraged tone by suggesting that Dr. Blackwell’s approval keeps moving out of the narrator’s reach.*  
D. It creates an angry tone by suggesting that Dr. Blackwell is deliberately avoiding the narrator.

**Correct Answer: C***

---

### Rationales

**A. It creates an excited tone by suggesting that the narrator is quickly approaching her goal.**  
This reverses the meaning. “Recedes” means to move back or away, not to come closer. The context—daily scoldings and doubt—also does not support an excited tone.

**B. It creates a hopeful tone by showing that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is getting closer over time.**  
Hopeful would fit if the word suggested progress, but “recedes” indicates the opposite. The narrator feels less, not more, confident about gaining approval.

**C. It creates a discouraged tone by suggesting that Dr. Blackwell’s approval keeps moving out of the narrator’s reach.***  
This is correct. “Recedes” figuratively describes approval as something that keeps slipping farther away the more she tries to get it. This choice captures both the figurative meaning and the discouraged tone.

**D. It creates an angry tone by suggesting that Dr. Blackwell is deliberately avoiding the narrator.**  
While “recedes” implies distance, the sentence does not say Dr. Blackwell is choosing to avoid her. The focus is on the narrator’s feelings of failure, not on blaming Dr. Blackwell’s intentions, so the tone is more discouraged than angry.

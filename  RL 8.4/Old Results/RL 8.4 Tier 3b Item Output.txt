1. Read the sentence from the passage.

> “It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it **recedes** in the distance.”

What is the most accurate meaning of the word **“recedes”** as it is used in this sentence?

A. It becomes less important to her over time.  
B. It moves farther away from her reach, as if it is going out of sight.*  
C. It becomes clearer and easier for her to understand.  
D. It suddenly appears in front of her, surprising her.

**Correct Answer: B***

---

### Rationales

**A. It becomes less important to her over time.**  
- This choice focuses on importance, not distance.  
- In the sentence, the narrator is still very focused on Dr. Blackwell’s approval; it has not become less important.  
- The phrase “farther it recedes in the distance” suggests physical or figurative movement away, not a change in how much she cares about it.  
- This shows a partial understanding that something is changing, but misreads the connotation of “recedes.”

**B. It moves farther away from her reach, as if it is going out of sight.*  
- “Recedes” literally means to move back or away, like the tide going out.  
- Here it is used figuratively: the approval is not literally moving, but it feels harder and harder for her to get.  
- The phrase “in the distance” reinforces this image of something moving away from her.  
- This captures both the meaning of the word and its figurative impact on tone: it emphasizes the narrator’s growing discouragement and sense that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is slipping out of reach.

**C. It becomes clearer and easier for her to understand.**  
- This is the opposite of what the sentence suggests.  
- “Recedes” does not mean “becomes clearer”; instead, it implies moving away and becoming less reachable or visible.  
- The narrator feels more doubtful and frustrated, not more understanding.

**D. It suddenly appears in front of her, surprising her.**  
- “Suddenly appears” is closer to “emerges” or “materializes,” which is not related to “recedes.”  
- The sentence describes a gradual process (“the more I seek… the farther it recedes”), not a sudden surprise.  
- This misreads both the meaning of the word and the cause-and-effect structure in the sentence.

Tier 3b (Claude) #1 (temp=0.7)

**Multiple Choice Item**

In the passage, when Diana describes seeking Dr. Blackwell's approval as something that "recedes in the distance," what does this phrase reveal about Diana's emotional state?

A. She feels confident that she will eventually earn Dr. Blackwell's respect through persistent effort.

B. She believes Dr. Blackwell is physically moving away from her during their interactions.

*C. She feels increasingly discouraged as her efforts to impress Dr. Blackwell seem to make things worse.

D. She thinks Dr. Blackwell is deliberately avoiding her to test her independence.

**Rationales:**

**Option A:** This choice misinterprets the connotative meaning of "recedes in the distance." A test taker might select this if they focus only on Diana's determination to "do better" without recognizing that the metaphor suggests her goal is becoming harder to reach, not that she feels confident about achieving it. The word "recedes" implies movement away from her, not eventual success.

**Option B:** This represents a literal misreading of the figurative language. A test taker might choose this if they fail to recognize that "recedes in the distance" is a metaphor for an increasingly unattainable goal, not a description of physical movement. The phrase describes Diana's emotional experience of seeking approval, not Dr. Blackwell's physical location.

***Option C (Key):** This correctly identifies the connotative meaning and emotional impact of the metaphor. "Recedes in the distance" suggests something moving farther away and becoming harder to reach, which reflects Diana's growing sense of discouragement. The phrase conveys her frustration that her increased efforts seem to be having the opposite effect—the more she tries, the more elusive Dr. Blackwell's approval becomes. This interpretation aligns with the surrounding context of Diana's self-doubt and repeated mistakes.

**Option D:** This choice incorrectly attributes intentional strategy to Dr. Blackwell's behavior. A test taker might select this if they misunderstand the metaphor as describing Dr. Blackwell's deliberate actions rather than Diana's subjective emotional experience. The phrase "recedes in the distance" describes how Diana perceives her goal of gaining approval, not Dr. Blackwell's teaching methods.

**Multiple Choice Item**

In the passage, when Diana describes seeking Dr. Blackwell's approval as something that "recedes in the distance," what does this phrase reveal about Diana's emotional state and her relationship with her mentor?

A. It shows that Diana is confident she will eventually earn Dr. Blackwell's respect through persistent effort.

B. It suggests that Diana is becoming indifferent to Dr. Blackwell's opinion and focusing on her patients instead.

*C. It conveys Diana's growing frustration and sense of hopelessness about ever meeting Dr. Blackwell's expectations.

D. It indicates that Diana believes Dr. Blackwell is deliberately avoiding her to test her independence.

**Rationales:**

**Option A Rationale:** This option misinterprets the connotative meaning of "recedes in the distance." While Diana does continue trying, the metaphor suggests movement away from her goal rather than confidence about achieving it. A test taker might choose this if they focus only on Diana's determination without recognizing the despair implied by the imagery of something moving farther away.

**Option B Rationale:** This option incorrectly suggests Diana is becoming indifferent. The metaphor actually indicates she cares deeply about the approval—so much that its seeming impossibility causes her distress. A test taker might select this if they misunderstand the emotional intensity conveyed by the figurative language, thinking "receding" suggests Diana is pulling away rather than the approval moving away from her.

***Option C Rationale (Correct Answer):** This option correctly identifies the connotative meaning of "recedes in the distance." The metaphor creates a visual image of something moving farther and farther away despite one's efforts to reach it, which perfectly captures Diana's mounting frustration and despair. The word choice emphasizes the emotional toll of repeatedly failing to gain approval, with "recedes" suggesting both gradual loss and inevitability, contributing to a tone of discouragement.

**Option D Rationale:** This option misreads the figurative language as literal strategic behavior by Dr. Blackwell. The metaphor describes Diana's internal emotional experience, not Dr. Blackwell's actions. A test taker might choose this if they fail to recognize the figurative nature of the phrase and instead interpret it as describing physical or intentional distance created by Dr. Blackwell.

This item aligns with RL.8.4 by requiring students to analyze how the specific metaphorical phrase "recedes in the distance" creates meaning beyond its literal sense, examining how this word choice impacts the tone and reveals Diana's emotional journey in her relationship with her mentor.

Tier 3b (Claude) #2 (temp=0.8)

**Multiple Choice Item**

In the passage, when Diana says she was "disabused of that notion" regarding finding a motherly figure in Dr. Blackwell, what does the word "disabused" suggest about the nature of Diana's realization?

A. It indicates that Diana gradually came to understand Dr. Blackwell's teaching methods over time.

*B. It reveals that Diana's expectations were forcefully corrected through harsh experience.

C. It shows that Dr. Blackwell intentionally deceived Diana about her personality from the beginning.

D. It suggests that Diana politely changed her mind after discussing the matter with Dr. Blackwell.

**Rationales:**

**Option A Rationale:** This option misses the connotative force of "disabused," which implies a sudden, jarring correction rather than gradual understanding. The word carries connotations of having illusions stripped away, not gentle learning over time. A test taker might choose this if they focus on the fact that Diana did learn something but miss the harsh, abrupt quality that "disabused" conveys.

***Option B Rationale (Correct Answer):** This option correctly captures the connotative meaning of "disabused." The word suggests having false beliefs or illusions forcefully removed, often through unpleasant experience. The prefix "dis-" indicates removal, while "abused" historically relates to deception or misuse. This word choice creates a tone of disillusionment and emphasizes that Diana's romantic notions about finding maternal comfort were harshly shattered by Dr. Blackwell's stern, professional demeanor during the public reprimand.

**Option C Rationale:** This option incorrectly places the agency of deception on Dr. Blackwell rather than recognizing that "disabused" refers to Diana's own mistaken assumptions being corrected. The word doesn't suggest intentional deception by another party, but rather the correction of one's own false beliefs. A test taker might select this if they misunderstand who was responsible for the original misconception.

**Option D Rationale:** This option completely misses the harsh connotations of "disabused." The word suggests a forceful, often unpleasant correction of false beliefs, not a polite conversation or gentle change of mind. A test taker might choose this if they don't recognize the strong negative connotations and think "disabused" is simply a formal way of saying "changed her opinion."

This item aligns with RL.8.4 by requiring students to analyze the specific connotative meaning of "disabused" and understand how this particular word choice emphasizes the jarring, unpleasant nature of Diana's realization, contributing to the tone of disillusionment in this section of the passage.

Tier 3b (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7)

1. Read this sentence from the passage:

> “It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it **recedes** in the distance.”

What is the effect of the word **“recedes”** in this sentence?

A. It suggests that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is slowly moving away from Diana, making it feel harder and harder to reach.*  
B. It suggests that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is completely gone and can never be recovered.  
C. It suggests that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is moving toward Diana, but she does not notice it.  
D. It suggests that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is standing still and waiting for Diana to catch up.

**Correct Answer: A***

---

### Rationales

**A. It suggests that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is slowly moving away from Diana, making it feel harder and harder to reach.*  
- “Recedes” literally means “moves back” or “moves farther away.”  
- In this figurative use, Diana compares approval to something in the distance that keeps moving away as she tries to reach it.  
- This word choice emphasizes her growing frustration and hopelessness, shaping a discouraged tone.

**B. It suggests that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is completely gone and can never be recovered.**  
- This would fit words like “disappeared” or “vanished,” but “recedes” implies moving away, not total loss.  
- The passage later shows Diana does earn praise, so the approval was not gone forever.

**C. It suggests that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is moving toward Diana, but she does not notice it.**  
- “Recedes” is the opposite of moving toward; it means moving back or away.  
- In the paragraph, Diana clearly feels the approval is getting more distant, not closer.

**D. It suggests that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is standing still and waiting for Diana to catch up.**  
- A stationary image would be conveyed by words like “remains” or “stays.”  
- “Recedes” creates an image of something actively moving farther away, intensifying Diana’s sense of failure rather than suggesting a fixed goal.

Tier 3b (GPT) #2 (temp=0.8)

2. Read this sentence from the passage:

> “If I was hoping to find a motherly figure in Dr. Blackwell, I was quickly **disabused** of that notion.”

What does the word **“disabused”** suggest about the narrator’s experience with Dr. Blackwell?

A. The narrator was gently guided to a better understanding of Dr. Blackwell’s caring personality.  
B. The narrator was firmly corrected and made to realize that her expectations about Dr. Blackwell were wrong.*  
C. The narrator was encouraged to keep believing that Dr. Blackwell would eventually act like a mother.  
D. The narrator was confused about whether Dr. Blackwell was strict or kind.

**Correct Answer: B***

---

### Rationales

**A. The narrator was gently guided to a better understanding of Dr. Blackwell’s caring personality.**  
- “Disabused” means to free someone from a false belief, often in a blunt or uncomfortable way, not a gentle one.  
- The context—public reprimands and lack of warmth—does not reveal a “caring personality” from the narrator’s point of view.

**B. The narrator was firmly corrected and made to realize that her expectations about Dr. Blackwell were wrong.*  
- This matches the connotation of “disabused”: she had a mistaken idea (that Dr. Blackwell would be “motherly”) and events quickly proved her wrong.  
- The surrounding details (being scolded in front of others) support a firm, even harsh, correction of her expectations.

**C. The narrator was encouraged to keep believing that Dr. Blackwell would eventually act like a mother.**  
- “Disabused” means the opposite of being encouraged to keep a belief; it means being stripped of that belief.  
- The sentence shows her hope for a “motherly figure” was taken away, not supported.

**D. The narrator was confused about whether Dr. Blackwell was strict or kind.**  
- “Disabused” indicates clarity, not confusion: the narrator now clearly knows Dr. Blackwell is not “motherly.”  
- The passage describes consistent scoldings, not mixed signals that would cause uncertainty.

Here’s a **Common Core RL.8.4-aligned multiple-choice item** based on the passage:

---

### **Item Stem**
In paragraph 10, the narrator says, *“I either freeze like a statue or make all manner of clumsy blunders.”* What is the effect of the phrase **“freeze like a statue”** on the tone of the passage?

---

### **Answer Options**
A. It emphasizes the narrator’s determination to remain calm under pressure.  
B. It conveys the narrator’s sense of being rigid and unable to act.*  
C. It suggests the narrator feels admired and important, like a statue in a public square.  
D. It shows the narrator’s confidence in handling medical tasks.

---

### **Correct Answer**
**B. It conveys the narrator’s sense of being rigid and unable to act.***  

---

### **Rationales**
- **A. It emphasizes the narrator’s determination to remain calm under pressure.**  
  *Incorrect.* The phrase does not suggest calmness; instead, it implies immobility and nervousness, which contrasts with determination.

- **B. It conveys the narrator’s sense of being rigid and unable to act.**  
  *Correct.* Comparing herself to a statue highlights her inability to move or respond effectively, reinforcing the tone of self-doubt and anxiety.

- **C. It suggests the narrator feels admired and important, like a statue in a public square.**  
  *Incorrect.* While statues can symbolize admiration, the context here is about feeling frozen and ineffective, not celebrated.

- **D. It shows the narrator’s confidence in handling medical tasks.**  
  *Incorrect.* The phrase indicates the opposite of confidence; it reflects insecurity and hesitation.

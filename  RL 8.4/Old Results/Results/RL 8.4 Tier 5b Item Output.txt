Tier 5b (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7)

1. Read the sentence from the passage.

> “It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it **recedes** in the distance.”

As it is used in this sentence, what is the most accurate meaning of the word “recedes”?

A. It becomes less important to her over time.  
B. It moves farther away from her reach.*  
C. It completely disappears from her life.  
D. It changes into something different.

**Correct Answer: B***

---

### Rationales

**A. It becomes less important to her over time.**  
- This choice focuses on importance, not distance.  
- In the sentence, “farther it recedes in the distance” creates an image of approval moving away, not becoming less important.  
- A student choosing this may focus on the emotional idea that approval “matters less,” but that is not what the figurative language conveys.

**B. It moves farther away from her reach.*  
- “Recedes in the distance” is figurative language suggesting that the approval she wants feels like it is moving away from her as she tries to get it.  
- “Recedes” literally means “moves back” or “withdraws,” and here it describes her approval feeling less attainable.  
- This option captures both the literal sense (moving back) and the connotative, emotional meaning (harder to achieve).

**C. It completely disappears from her life.**  
- “Recedes” suggests something is going away or becoming more distant, not instantly vanishing.  
- Nothing in the passage says Dr. Blackwell’s approval is gone forever; it just feels harder to get.  
- Students might pick this if they overstate the word’s meaning.

**D. It changes into something different.**  
- This confuses “recedes” with “transforms” or “evolves.”  
- In the sentence, approval is still approval; it doesn’t change into something else. It only feels farther away.  
- This option does not match the image of something “in the distance.”

2. Read this sentence from the passage.

> “If I was hoping to find a motherly figure in Dr. Blackwell, I was quickly **disabused of that notion**.”

What does the phrase “disabused of that notion” most nearly mean as it is used in this sentence?

A. I was gently encouraged to keep believing that idea.  
B. I was forced to admit that my idea was wrong.*  
C. I was persuaded to change my idea to a different one.  
D. I was reminded that my idea was not very important.

**Correct Answer: B***

---

### Rationales

**A. I was gently encouraged to keep believing that idea.**  
- “Disabused” means to correct a false belief, not to support it.  
- The context shows Dr. Blackwell is strict and publicly reprimands the narrator, which would not encourage the “motherly” idea.  
- This is the opposite of the sentence’s meaning.

**B. I was forced to admit that my idea was wrong.*  
- “Disabused of that notion” is an idiomatic phrase meaning someone’s mistaken belief has been taken away.  
- The narrator expected a “motherly figure,” but Dr. Blackwell’s sharp public scoldings prove that belief false.  
- This option best matches both the literal meaning of “disabused” and the context of the narrator’s disappointment.

**C. I was persuaded to change my idea to a different one.**  
- This suggests a neutral change, but “disabused” carries the connotation of being corrected or set straight about a mistaken belief.  
- Nothing in the sentence suggests a gentle “persuasion” or a simple swap of ideas; it emphasizes that the hope was wrong.

**D. I was reminded that my idea was not very important.**  
- The phrase does not refer to importance; it refers to accuracy.  
- The narrator’s hope is clearly important to her; what changes is whether it is realistic.  
- This misreads the emotional and figurative impact of the phrase.

================= NEW ITEM =================
Tier 5b (Claude) #1 (temp=0.7)

**Multiple Choice Item**

In the passage, when Diana describes Dr. Blackwell's approval as something that "recedes in the distance," the author uses this phrase to suggest that Diana's goal of earning respect:

A. is geographically far away since she lives in a different state
B. requires her to travel to distant medical schools for training  
*C. becomes harder to achieve the more desperately she pursues it
D. will take a long time to accomplish due to her inexperience

**Rationales:**

**Option A Rationale:** This response demonstrates a literal, surface-level interpretation of "recedes in the distance." A student selecting this option likely focuses on the denotative meaning of "distance" as a physical space or location, missing the figurative use of the phrase. They may connect this to the earlier mention of Diana moving to New York, but fail to recognize that the phrase is used metaphorically to describe an emotional/professional relationship rather than geographic proximity.

**Option B Rationale:** Similar to Option A, this response shows literal interpretation of "distance" but attempts to connect it to the medical training context. Students choosing this option recognize the passage is about medical education but misunderstand the figurative language, interpreting "distance" as physical travel requirements rather than the metaphorical description of an increasingly elusive goal.

***Option C Rationale (CORRECT):** This response demonstrates understanding of the figurative meaning of "recedes in the distance." The phrase creates a visual metaphor comparing Dr. Blackwell's approval to something that moves farther away as one tries to approach it. Students selecting this option recognize that Diana's increasingly desperate attempts to gain approval actually make her more nervous and prone to mistakes, thus making her goal paradoxically harder to achieve. This interpretation aligns with the context of Diana's growing anxiety and self-consciousness under Dr. Blackwell's scrutiny.

**Option D Rationale:** This response shows partial understanding that "distance" relates to time/difficulty rather than physical space, but misses the specific connotative meaning in context. Students choosing this option may recognize the figurative use but fail to grasp the ironic relationship the author establishes—that Diana's very efforts to gain approval are what make it more elusive. Instead, they interpret it as a straightforward statement about the time required for skill development.

**LBIDAT Analysis:**

Tier 5b (Claude) #2 (temp=0.8)

**Multiple Choice Item**

In the passage, when Diana describes feeling "like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar" after Dr. Blackwell's reprimand, this comparison reveals that Diana feels:

A. hungry and distracted by thoughts of food during work
B. tempted to take medical supplies that don't belong to her
*C. guilty and ashamed despite believing her actions were justified
D. nostalgic for the simpler times of her childhood

**Rationales:**

**Option A Rationale:** This response demonstrates a literal interpretation of the simile, focusing on the denotative meanings of "child" and "sweets" rather than the figurative comparison. Students selecting this option miss the metaphorical nature of the comparison and instead interpret it as Diana literally thinking about food. They fail to recognize that the simile is used to convey an emotional state rather than describe actual hunger or distraction.

**Option B Rationale:** This response shows partial understanding that the comparison involves wrongdoing, but misapplies it literally to the medical setting. Students choosing this option recognize that "sneaking" and "caught" suggest inappropriate behavior, but they interpret this concretely rather than figuratively. They miss that Diana believes her actions (comforting the patient) were appropriate, and the simile describes her emotional response to being treated as if she did something wrong.

***Option C Rationale (CORRECT):** This response demonstrates full understanding of the simile's figurative meaning and connotative impact. The comparison to a child caught sneaking sweets captures the specific emotional experience of feeling guilty and ashamed when reprimanded, even though Diana believes her comforting words to the patient were justified and appropriate. Students selecting this option recognize that the simile conveys Diana's sense of being unfairly treated like a misbehaving child, which creates tension between her professional judgment and her subordinate position.

**Option D Rationale:** This response recognizes the reference to childhood but misinterprets the emotional tone and purpose of the simile. Students choosing this option may understand that childhood is being referenced figuratively, but they miss the negative connotations of being "caught" doing something wrong. They focus on childhood as a time period rather than understanding how the specific scenario (being caught misbehaving) creates feelings of shame and injustice in the adult Diana.

**LBIDAT Analysis:**
- **Stem & Task: ✓** - Directly targets RL.8.4 by asking students to analyze a simile's figurative meaning and emotional impact
- **Key: ✓** - Definitively correct and requires understanding of connotative meaning beyond literal interpretation
- **Distractors: ✓** - Each represents different levels of misunderstanding of the figurative language
- **Stimulus: ✓** - Item requires analysis of the specific simile in context to understand Diana's emotional state
- **Fairness: ✓** - No inappropriate sensitivity issues

================= NEW ITEM =================
Tier 5b (Gemini) #1 (temp=0.7)

Here is a multiple-choice item written to the specifications provided.

***

**Passage:** Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant
**Standard:** RL.8.4: Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text, including figurative and connotative meanings; analyze the impact of specific word choices on meaning and tone, including analogies or allusions to other texts.
**Item:**

Read this sentence from paragraph 9.

> Once again, I felt unjustly reprimanded, like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar.

What does the author’s use of the phrase “like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar” reveal about the narrator?

*A. It shows the narrator feels her actions were harmless and the doctor’s reaction was overly harsh.
B. It suggests the narrator is immature and not ready for the responsibilities of being a doctor.
C. It indicates the narrator feels guilty for disobeying the doctor’s rules about idle conversation.
D. It implies the narrator is embarrassed that she was scolded in front of one of her patients.

***

### Rationales

**A. (Key):** The student correctly interprets the simile. The act of "sneaking sweets" is a minor, childish misdeed, not a serious offense. By comparing her situation to this, the narrator, Diana, implies that her action of speaking soothingly to a patient was equally minor and well-intentioned. The feeling of being "caught" and reprimanded for such an act suggests a punishment that is out of proportion to the offense. This aligns perfectly with the text where Diana explicitly feels "unjustly reprimanded," indicating she believes Dr. Blackwell’s sharp reaction was too severe.

**B. (Distractor):** The student misinterprets the purpose of the figurative language. The narrator uses the comparison to a "child" to describe how she *feels* she is being treated by Dr. Blackwell in that moment—as if she is small, foolish, and deserving of a scolding. She is not using the comparison to make a statement about her own actual maturity or fitness for her job. The rest of the passage, particularly her competent performance during the busy evening, contradicts the idea that she is truly immature.

**C. (Distractor):** The student focuses on one part of the simile ("caught") while ignoring a key word in the sentence ("unjustly"). The narrator explicitly states that she feels the reprimand is unfair. A person who feels guilty would not typically describe their punishment as unjust. Therefore, the simile is meant to convey a sense of indignation at being unfairly treated, not an admission of guilt.

**D. (Distractor):** The student identifies an emotion that is plausible in the situation but is not the primary meaning of the simile itself. While Diana is likely embarrassed (the next sentence says the patient's sympathetic look "only made me feel worse"), the specific comparison to "a child caught sneaking sweets" is chosen to highlight the perceived injustice of the situation—the mismatch between a small, harmless act and a sharp, corrective response—rather than the public nature of the scolding.

Tier 5b (Gemini) #2 (temp=0.8)

Of course. Here is another unique multiple-choice item based on the same passage and standard.

***

**Passage:** Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant
**Standard:** RL.8.4: Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text, including figurative and connotative meanings; analyze the impact of specific word choices on meaning and tone, including analogies or allusions to other texts.
**Item:**

Read this sentence from paragraph 4.

> It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance.

What is the main effect of the figurative language in this sentence?

A. It suggests that Dr. Blackwell is deliberately making the narrator’s tasks more difficult.
B. It reveals that the narrator is losing her motivation to become a doctor.
*C. It emphasizes the narrator’s feeling that her goal of pleasing the doctor is impossible to achieve.
D. It implies that the narrator believes she is physically too far away from the doctor to be noticed.

***

### Rationales

**A. (Distractor):** This option incorrectly assigns agency to Dr. Blackwell within the metaphor. The figurative language focuses on the narrator's perception of "approval" as a goal that is moving away from her. While Dr. Blackwell's actions cause this feeling, the phrase itself describes the effect on the narrator (the goal seems impossible) rather than the doctor's specific intent to make things harder.

**B. (Distractor):** This option misinterprets the narrator's emotional state. The sentence conveys frustration and a sense of futility, but the narrator's actions and thoughts in the surrounding paragraphs show she is still highly motivated. In the very next paragraph, she says, "I must somehow manage to do better...and gain the doctor's respect." This indicates her motivation remains strong despite her discouragement.

**C. (Key):** The student correctly analyzes the metaphor. The image of a destination that "recedes in the distance" as one walks toward it is a powerful way to express a futile or impossible effort. By applying this image to gaining Dr. Blackwell's approval, the narrator emphasizes her growing despair and her belief that no matter how hard she tries, she will never reach her goal.

**D. (Distractor):** This option represents a literal and incorrect interpretation of the figurative language. The phrase "recedes in the distance" is used metaphorically to describe the narrator's emotional and professional struggle, not a physical distance between her and Dr. Blackwell. Students who choose this option are not recognizing the non-literal meaning of the phrase.

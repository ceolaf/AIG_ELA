1. Read the sentence from the passage.

   “Every day has brought at least one similar scolding. **It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance.**”

   What is the effect of the phrase “the farther it recedes in the distance” on the meaning and tone of the sentence?

   A. It suggests that Dr. Blackwell is physically moving away from Diana, creating a tone of adventure and travel.  
   B. It shows that Diana feels that earning Dr. Blackwell’s approval is becoming less likely the harder she tries, creating a tone of frustration and discouragement.*  
   C. It indicates that Dr. Blackwell is gradually forgetting about Diana, creating a tone of relief and freedom.  
   D. It reveals that Diana is literally losing her eyesight, creating a tone of fear and confusion.

**Correct Answer: B***

---

### Rationales

**Option B (Correct):**  
- The phrase “the farther it recedes in the distance” is figurative language. Approval is not a physical object that can literally move away.  
- By comparing approval to something that keeps moving farther away as she moves toward it, the narrator shows that the more effort she makes, the less attainable that approval seems.  
- This contributes to a tone of frustration and discouragement, because Diana feels her goal is slipping away despite her hard work.

**Option A (Distractor):**  
- Misinterprets the figurative phrase as describing physical movement and “distance” in a literal sense.  
- There is no evidence in the passage that Dr. Blackwell is traveling or moving away from Diana; the sentence is about emotional distance and approval, not geography.  
- The tone in this part of the passage is anxious and self-doubting, not adventurous.

**Option C (Distractor):**  
- Suggests that Dr. Blackwell is forgetting Diana and that this makes Diana feel relieved and free.  
- This conflicts with the passage: Diana wants Dr. Blackwell’s attention and respect; she fears being “sent away,” not being forgotten.  
- The figurative “recedes in the distance” describes Diana’s sense that approval is harder to reach, not that Dr. Blackwell is forgetting her.

**Option D (Distractor):**  
- Takes the language literally, as if Diana’s physical eyesight is failing and affecting what she can see.  
- The passage does not mention any eye problems; instead, it focuses on Diana’s emotional struggle and desire for professional approval.  
- The tone is not fearful about health but worried about competence and respect.

2. Read this sentence from the passage:

   “If I was hoping to find a motherly figure in Dr. Blackwell, I was quickly **disabused of that notion**.”

   What does the phrase “disabused of that notion” most nearly mean as it is used in this sentence?

   A. I was gently encouraged to keep believing that idea.  
   B. I was slowly persuaded to improve on that idea.  
   C. I was quickly corrected and made to realize that idea was wrong.*  
   D. I was secretly praised for having that idea.

**Correct Answer: C***

---

### Rationales

**Option C (Correct):**  
- “Disabused of that notion” is a figurative phrase meaning to be shown that a belief is false.  
- In context, the narrator expected Dr. Blackwell to be “a motherly figure,” but then describes being publicly reprimanded on the first day and scolded daily afterward.  
- These details show that she quickly learns her assumption was incorrect, so the phrase means she was corrected and made to realize the idea was wrong.

**Option A (Distractor):**  
- Says she was encouraged to *keep* believing the idea, which is the opposite of “disabused.”  
- The harsh public reprimands and repeated scoldings clearly do not support the idea that Dr. Blackwell is motherly.

**Option B (Distractor):**  
- Suggests the idea was “improved,” not rejected.  
- The sentence signals a complete change of belief, not a revision or improvement; “disabused” implies being freed from a false belief, not modifying it.

**Option D (Distractor):**  
- Implies praise, which does not match the tone or events.  
- The narrator describes feeling “unjustly reprimanded, like a child,” which indicates criticism, not secret approval or praise.

**Multiple Choice Item Aligned to RL.8.4**

In the passage, Diana describes feeling "like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar" when Dr. Blackwell reprimands her. What does this simile reveal about Diana's emotional state and the tone of the scene?

A. It shows Diana's defiance and creates a tone of rebellion against authority.

B. It demonstrates Diana's confusion and establishes a tone of mystery about Dr. Blackwell's expectations.

C. It reveals Diana's professional confidence and creates a tone of competence in the medical setting.

*D. It conveys Diana's feelings of shame and embarrassment, creating a tone of tension and discomfort in their relationship.

**Rationales:**

**Option A:** This response misinterprets the simile's meaning. A child "caught sneaking sweets" typically feels guilty or ashamed rather than defiant. Diana's behavior throughout the passage shows respect for Dr. Blackwell's authority, not rebellion. She "bit my tongue and said nothing," which indicates submission rather than defiance. The tone is not one of rebellion but rather discomfort and tension.

**Option B:** While Diana may experience some confusion about Dr. Blackwell's expectations, the simile specifically captures feelings of being caught doing something wrong, which relates more to shame than confusion. The tone is not mysterious—Dr. Blackwell's disapproval is quite clear and direct. The simile emphasizes emotional discomfort rather than intellectual puzzlement about expectations.

**Option C:** This option completely contradicts the simile's meaning. A child caught sneaking sweets feels guilty and embarrassed, not confident. Diana explicitly states she feels she "could do nothing right" and describes making "clumsy blunders." The medical setting tone at this moment is uncomfortable and tense, not one of professional competence.

***Option D:** This is correct because the simile of a child caught sneaking sweets directly conveys feelings of guilt, shame, and embarrassment—exactly what Diana experiences when reprimanded. The comparison emphasizes how small and wrong she feels in that moment. This creates a tone of tension and discomfort in her relationship with Dr. Blackwell, as evidenced by Diana's statement that the sympathetic look from her patient "only made me feel worse."

**Multiple Choice Item Aligned to RL.8.4**

In the passage, Diana states that Dr. Blackwell's approval "seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance." What does the phrase "recedes in the distance" suggest about Diana's struggle, and how does it affect the tone?

A. It implies that Dr. Blackwell is physically moving away from Diana, creating a tone of abandonment.

*B. It suggests that gaining approval feels like chasing something that becomes more unreachable with effort, creating a tone of frustration and desperation.

C. It indicates that Diana is making steady progress toward her goal, establishing a tone of optimism and determination.

D. It shows that Dr. Blackwell's expectations are unclear, creating a tone of confusion and uncertainty.

**Rationales:**

**Option A:** This response takes the phrase too literally. Diana is not describing Dr. Blackwell physically moving away from her, but rather using figurative language to describe the emotional experience of trying to gain approval. The tone is not about abandonment but about the futility of her efforts despite staying in the same workplace. The metaphor relates to emotional distance in achievement, not physical separation.

***Option B:** This is correct because "recedes in the distance" creates a metaphor comparing Dr. Blackwell's approval to something Diana is chasing that moves further away the harder she pursues it. This figurative language effectively captures the frustrating cycle where increased effort leads to seeming failure, making the goal feel more unreachable. The tone becomes one of desperation and frustration as Diana realizes her intense desire to please may actually be working against her.

**Option C:** This option misinterprets the meaning entirely. When something "recedes in the distance," it moves farther away, not closer. Diana is describing the opposite of progress—she's explaining how her goal becomes more elusive despite her efforts. The tone at this point in the passage is not optimistic but rather discouraged, as she fears being "sent away" and having her hopes "extinguished."

**Option D:** While Diana may experience some uncertainty, the phrase "recedes in the distance" specifically emphasizes the elusiveness of achieving approval rather than unclear expectations. Dr. Blackwell's expectations are actually quite clear through her direct reprimands. The metaphor focuses on Diana's sense that success is slipping away from her, creating frustration rather than mere confusion about what is expected.

================= NEW ITEM =================
Tier 2a (Gemini) #1 (temp=0.7)

Here is a unique multiple-choice item, with rationales, based on the provided passage and aligned to the specified standard.

***

**Item**

Read this sentence from paragraph 4.

> It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance.

How does this metaphor contribute to the tone of the paragraph?

A. It creates a critical tone by suggesting that Dr. Blackwell is deliberately ignoring the narrator.
B. It creates a detached tone by showing the narrator is losing her desire to impress Dr. Blackwell.
C. It creates a frustrated tone by emphasizing the narrator’s feeling that her goal is impossible to reach. *
D. It creates a mysterious tone by implying that the narrator does not understand what Dr. Blackwell wants from her.

**Rationales**

*   **A. Rationale:** This option is incorrect. The metaphor describes the narrator’s perception of her goal, not a specific action by Dr. Blackwell. While Dr. Blackwell is strict, the phrase “recedes in the distance” focuses on the unattainability of the approval from the narrator’s point of view, rather than suggesting a deliberate act of ignoring her.
*   **B. Rationale:** This option is incorrect. The text states the opposite; the narrator is actively seeking Dr. Blackwell’s approval. The metaphor highlights her struggle and desire, not a growing detachment or lack of interest.
*   **C. Rationale:** This is the correct option. A receding object is one that moves farther away, becoming harder to reach or see. By comparing Dr. Blackwell's approval to something that “recedes in the distance,” the narrator powerfully conveys her growing frustration and hopelessness, as her goal seems to become more unattainable the harder she works for it. This directly contributes to the paragraph's frustrated and anxious tone.
*   **D. Rationale:** This option is incorrect. While the narrator is struggling, the metaphor does not primarily suggest a sense of mystery or confusion about Dr. Blackwell’s expectations. It is focused on the *outcome* of her efforts—failure and the feeling that the goal is unreachable—which creates a tone of frustration, not mystery.

Of course. Here is another unique multiple-choice item, with rationales, based on the provided passage and aligned to the specified standard.

**Item**

Read this sentence from paragraph 9.

> Once again, I felt unjustly reprimanded, like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar.

What is the primary effect of the simile in this sentence?

A. It shows that the narrator recognizes she has done something wrong and feels guilty.
B. It reveals that the narrator views Dr. Blackwell as a caring but strict parental figure.
C. It suggests that the narrator is becoming openly defiant toward Dr. Blackwell’s authority.
D. It emphasizes that the narrator feels the scolding is for a minor mistake and makes her feel small.*

**Rationales**

*   **A. Rationale:** This option is incorrect. The narrator explicitly states that she feels "unjustly reprimanded," which indicates she does not believe her actions were wrong or warranted such a harsh scolding. The simile highlights her feeling of embarrassment, not guilt.
*   **B. Rationale:** This option is incorrect. Although the simile involves a child, the narrator has already stated in paragraph 4 that she was "quickly disabused" of the notion that Dr. Blackwell was a "motherly figure." The comparison serves to illustrate the power imbalance and her feelings of being belittled, not to define their relationship as parental.
*   **C. Rationale:** This option is incorrect. The simile conveys a feeling of being caught and shamed, not of defiance. A child caught sneaking sweets is typically embarrassed or chagrined, not actively rebellious. The narrator’s internal reaction is frustration, but her outward response is to "bite my tongue and say nothing."
*   **D. Rationale:** This is the correct option. The act of a child "sneaking sweets from a jar" is a minor, almost trivial, offense. By comparing Dr. Blackwell’s scolding to this scenario, the narrator emphasizes her perspective that her action (soothing a patient) was harmless and the reprimand was disproportionately harsh. The comparison to a "child" effectively conveys her feeling of being belittled and made to feel powerless in that moment.

Tier 4b #1 (Temp = 0.7)
1. In paragraph 4, the narrator says, “It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance.” What is the effect of this figurative language on the meaning and tone of the paragraph?

A. It shows that Dr. Blackwell is physically moving away from the narrator, creating a tone of fear and danger.  
B. It suggests that the narrator’s goal of earning Dr. Blackwell’s praise feels unreachable, creating a tone of frustration and discouragement.*  
C. It reveals that Dr. Blackwell is losing interest in teaching, creating a tone of boredom and indifference.  
D. It indicates that the narrator plans to leave the clinic soon, creating a tone of relief and anticipation.

**Rationales**

- **A. It shows that Dr. Blackwell is physically moving away from the narrator, creating a tone of fear and danger.**  
  This misreads the figurative language as literal. “Approval” cannot literally move away; it is an abstract idea. The tone in the paragraph is not fear or danger but emotional discouragement.

- **B. It suggests that the narrator’s goal of earning Dr. Blackwell’s praise feels unreachable, creating a tone of frustration and discouragement.*  
  This is correct. The phrase “the farther it recedes in the distance” is a metaphor comparing Dr. Blackwell’s approval to something that keeps moving away as the narrator moves toward it. This emphasizes how unreachable that approval feels and contributes to a frustrated, discouraged tone.

- **C. It reveals that Dr. Blackwell is losing interest in teaching, creating a tone of boredom and indifference.**  
  The sentence focuses on the narrator’s feelings about approval, not on Dr. Blackwell’s interest in teaching. The tone is not boredom or indifference; it is the narrator’s anxiety and discouragement about not measuring up.

- **D. It indicates that the narrator plans to leave the clinic soon, creating a tone of relief and anticipation.**  
  The narrator fears being sent away and wants to stay to become a doctor. There is no indication of relief or anticipation about leaving, so this conflicts with the passage’s meaning and tone.

Tier 4b (Claude) #1 (temp=0.7)

**Item:**

In the passage, when Diana describes seeking Dr. Blackwell's approval, she states, "It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance." What is the impact of the phrase "recedes in the distance" in this context?

A. It suggests that Dr. Blackwell physically moves away from Diana during their interactions.

B. It emphasizes that gaining approval requires Diana to travel to distant locations for training.

C. It conveys that Dr. Blackwell's approval becomes increasingly difficult and unlikely to obtain.

*D. It illustrates how Diana's efforts to impress Dr. Blackwell seem to push the goal of earning respect further away.

**Rationales:**

**Option A Rationale:** This response focuses on the literal, denotative meaning of "recedes in the distance" as physical movement away. A student choosing this option is not recognizing the figurative use of the phrase and is interpreting it only at surface level, missing the metaphorical meaning that creates the emotional tone of frustration and discouragement in Diana's experience.

**Option B Rationale:** This response also interprets "distance" literally, connecting it to the idea of physical travel or location. Students selecting this option are not understanding that the phrase is used metaphorically to describe an emotional or psychological experience rather than a literal geographical one, and they may be confused by the earlier mention of Diana moving to New York.

**Option C Rationale:** This response recognizes that the phrase is used figuratively rather than literally, understanding that "approval" is the subject that "recedes." However, it focuses primarily on the difficulty of obtaining approval rather than capturing the more specific meaning about how Diana's own efforts seem counterproductive—that her very attempts to seek approval are what cause it to become more elusive.

**Option D Rationale (Key):** This response demonstrates full understanding of the figurative meaning and its impact on tone. The phrase "recedes in the distance" is used metaphorically to describe how Diana's goal (approval) seems to move further away the harder she tries to reach it, creating a sense of frustration and futility. The word choice emphasizes the ironic and discouraging nature of her situation—that her efforts are counterproductive—which contributes to the tone of self-doubt and anxiety that characterizes Diana's narrative voice throughout this section of the passage.

**Item:**

In the passage, when Diana describes seeking Dr. Blackwell's approval, she states, "It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance." What is the impact of the phrase "recedes in the distance" in this context?

A. It suggests that Dr. Blackwell is physically moving away from Diana during their interactions.

B. It emphasizes that gaining approval requires Diana to travel to distant locations for training.

C. It conveys that Dr. Blackwell's approval becomes increasingly difficult to obtain despite Diana's efforts.

*D. It creates the impression that Dr. Blackwell's approval feels like an unreachable goal that grows more elusive with each attempt.

**Rationales:**

**Option A:** This response focuses on the literal, denotative meaning of "recedes in the distance" as physical movement. A student selecting this option misses the figurative use of the phrase and interprets it too literally, failing to recognize that the author is using spatial imagery metaphorically to describe an emotional/professional relationship rather than describing actual physical positioning.

**Option B:** This response also interprets the phrase too literally, connecting "distance" to physical travel and locations. Students choosing this option may recognize that the phrase relates to Diana's professional development but fail to understand the figurative meaning, instead creating a concrete interpretation about geographic distance and training requirements that isn't supported by the text.

**Option C:** This response demonstrates partial understanding of the figurative meaning, recognizing that the phrase relates to difficulty in obtaining approval. However, it doesn't fully capture the specific connotative impact of "recedes in the distance" - the image of something moving away from you as you pursue it, which creates a sense of futility and the goal becoming more remote with effort.

***Option D (Key):** This response demonstrates full understanding of how the author's word choice creates meaning beyond the literal. The phrase "recedes in the distance" uses spatial imagery figuratively to convey that Dr. Blackwell's approval feels like a destination that moves farther away as Diana tries to reach it. This creates a tone of frustration and futility, suggesting that Diana's efforts are counterproductive - the harder she tries, the more elusive the goal becomes. The connotative meaning adds emotional depth to Diana's struggle and emphasizes the psychological impact of her repeated failures.

**Item:**

In the passage, Diana describes feeling "like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar" when Dr. Blackwell reprimands her. How does this comparison function in the text?

A. It shows that Diana has a sweet tooth and often thinks about food when she's hungry during long shifts.

B. It demonstrates that Diana is too immature to work in a medical setting and should return home.

*C. It conveys Diana's sense of shame and feeling unfairly treated, while emphasizing the power imbalance between her and Dr. Blackwell.

D. It suggests that Diana actually did something wrong and deserved to be scolded for her unprofessional behavior.

**Rationales:**

**Option A:** This response misses the figurative nature of the comparison entirely, interpreting "sneaking sweets from a jar" literally as being about food and hunger. Students selecting this option fail to recognize that this is a simile used to convey emotional experience rather than a literal reference to Diana's eating habits or thoughts about food during her work.

**Option B:** This response recognizes that the comparison relates to childishness but misinterprets its purpose in the text. While the simile does reference childhood, students choosing this option miss that Diana uses this comparison to express how she *feels* when treated unfairly, not to suggest she actually *is* immature. They fail to understand that the author uses this analogy to critique the treatment Diana receives, not Diana herself.

***Option C (Key):** This response demonstrates full understanding of how the analogy functions. The comparison to "a child caught sneaking sweets" captures multiple layers of meaning: the shame and embarrassment of being caught doing something wrong, the sense of being treated as inferior or juvenile, and the power dynamic between an authority figure and someone in a subordinate position. The word "unjustly" in the text reinforces that Diana feels this treatment is unfair, and the analogy emphasizes how diminishing and inappropriate Dr. Blackwell's public reprimand feels to Diana.

**Option D:** This response misses the key word "unjustly" that precedes the analogy in the text. Students selecting this option may understand that the comparison relates to wrongdoing but fail to recognize that Diana is expressing her feeling of being unfairly treated. The analogy is meant to convey Diana's emotional experience of shame despite believing she didn't deserve such harsh treatment, not to suggest she actually did something wrong.

================= NEW ITEM =================
Tier 4b (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7)

1. Read this sentence from the passage:

> “It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it **recedes** in the distance.”

As it is used in this sentence, what is the **best** meaning of the word **“recedes”**?

A. It becomes less important to her over time.  
B. It moves farther away from her reach.*  
C. It slowly disappears from her memory.  
D. It changes into something entirely different.

**Correct Answer: B***

---

### Rationales

**A. It becomes less important to her over time.**  
- This choice focuses on importance, but the sentence uses the image “in the distance,” suggesting physical movement away, not just a change in importance.  
- A student choosing this may notice the emotional distance but miss the figurative “moving farther away” idea.

**B. It moves farther away from her reach.*  
- “Recedes” literally means to move back or away.  
- In context, the narrator is using figurative language: Dr. Blackwell’s approval is compared to something that keeps moving farther away the more she tries to reach it.  
- This captures both the literal sense (moving back) and the connotation of something she is struggling, and failing, to attain. This aligns with RL.8.4 by interpreting the figurative use in this specific sentence.

**C. It slowly disappears from her memory.**  
- “Recedes” can sometimes describe memories fading, but here the sentence is about “seeking her approval,” not remembering it.  
- The phrase “in the distance” suggests spatial distance, not forgetting.  
- A student picking this is overgeneralizing another possible meaning of “recedes” without attending to the specific context.

**D. It changes into something entirely different.**  
- This describes transformation, which is not suggested by the sentence.  
- The approval does not change into something else; it simply seems harder to obtain.  
- This option is definitively incorrect and does not fit the figurative image in the text.

2. Read this sentence from the passage:

> “If I was hoping to find a **motherly figure** in Dr. Blackwell, I was quickly **disabused** of that notion.”

What does the phrase **“disabused of that notion”** most nearly mean as it is used in this sentence?

A. I was gently encouraged to keep that belief.  
B. I was suddenly confused about that belief.  
C. I was forced to give up that belief.*  
D. I was able to prove that belief was correct.

**Correct Answer: C***

---

### Rationales

**A. I was gently encouraged to keep that belief.**  
- “Disabused” suggests correcting a false idea, not supporting it.  
- In context, Dr. Blackwell reprimands the narrator publicly, which shows she is not “motherly.” This conflicts with the idea of being encouraged to keep the belief.

**B. I was suddenly confused about that belief.**  
- Confusion would mean the narrator is unsure.  
- Instead, the narrator becomes more certain that Dr. Blackwell is *not* a motherly figure. The belief is corrected, not made uncertain.

**C. I was forced to give up that belief.*  
- “Disabused” means to cause someone to stop believing something that is not true.  
- The narrator hoped for a warm, gentle “motherly figure,” but Dr. Blackwell’s harsh public scoldings show that idea was wrong.  
- This choice captures the figurative use of “disabused” and shows how word choice shapes the tone of disappointment and correction.

**D. I was able to prove that belief was correct.**  
- This is the opposite of what “disabused” means.  
- The events described—public reprimands, lack of motherly behavior—prove the belief *wrong*, not correct.

“This standard is about subtleties of language and word choice, with particular focus on connotative meaning and the impact of a particularly chosen word on the tone of the text. This often takes the form of non-literal use of words, as that can increase the importance of connotative meanings of words. Items should highlight the subtle impacts of particular word choice. This requires words that test takers may be expected to already know.”

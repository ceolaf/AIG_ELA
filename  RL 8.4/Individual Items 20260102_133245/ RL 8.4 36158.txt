Here is a multiple choice item aligned to RL.8.4:

**Item:**

In the passage, the narrator states that Dr. Blackwell's approval "recedes in the distance." In this context, what does the phrase "recedes in the distance" suggest about the narrator's relationship with Dr. Blackwell?

A. The narrator is physically moving farther away from Dr. Blackwell each day.

B. The narrator's memory of Dr. Blackwell's past praise is becoming unclear.

*C. The narrator feels that earning Dr. Blackwell's respect is becoming increasingly difficult to achieve.

D. The narrator believes Dr. Blackwell is deliberately avoiding spending time with her.

**Rationales:**

**Option A:** This response focuses on the literal, spatial meaning of "recedes in the distance," interpreting it as physical movement. However, the author is using this phrase figuratively to describe an emotional and professional dynamic, not a literal geographical relationship. Students choosing this option are missing the figurative language and focusing only on denotative meaning.

**Option B:** This interpretation incorrectly connects "recedes" with fading memory rather than understanding it in the context of the narrator's ongoing struggle. While "recedes" can relate to memory, the passage context shows the narrator is actively seeking approval in the present, not reflecting on past praise that is becoming unclear.

**Option C (Key):** This response correctly recognizes that "recedes in the distance" is used figuratively to convey how Dr. Blackwell's approval feels increasingly unattainable. The phrase creates a metaphorical image of a goal moving away as one tries to reach it, perfectly capturing the narrator's frustration that her efforts to gain respect seem to be having the opposite effect. This word choice emphasizes the narrator's sense of discouragement and the seemingly impossible nature of her goal.

**Option D:** This response misinterprets the figurative language as referring to Dr. Blackwell's intentional behavior rather than the narrator's perception of achieving approval. The passage shows Dr. Blackwell is present and engaged (giving reprimands, working alongside the narrator), so this interpretation doesn't align with the context or the figurative meaning of the phrase.

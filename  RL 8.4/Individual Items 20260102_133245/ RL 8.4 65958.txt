**Rationales**

*   **A. (Correct):** This option correctly analyzes the connotative meaning of "curiosity" in this context. A "curiosity" is often a strange or rare object one looks at, like an item in a collection or a sideshow. By using this word to describe female doctors, the author highlights that they are not yet seen as legitimate, capable professionals on par with men, but rather as novelties. This choice accurately captures the impact of the word on the meaning—it reveals the societal prejudice and lack of professional respect these women faced.

*   **B. (Incorrect):** This option assigns a positive connotation to the word "curiosity" that is not supported by the passage. While being curious can mean being interested in learning, the context here suggests a more detached and less respectful form of interest. The paragraph states that patients come to the clinic out of financial necessity and are more comfortable with women, but it also notes they "cannot afford to doubt us," implying their confidence is not strong. This distractor misreads the tone and the specific connotation of being treated *like* a curiosity.

*   **C. (Incorrect):** This option misinterprets the focus of the word. The word "curiosity" is used to describe how female doctors are perceived by society, not the complexity of their medical work. The text does not suggest their work is mysterious or hard to understand; it suggests their *gender* in that professional role is what is considered strange. This is an error in connecting the word's impact to the wrong aspect of the text.

*   **D. (Incorrect):** This option misapplies the narrator's statement. The narrator is describing how *patients and society* view female doctors, not how she views her own ambition. Throughout the passage, Diana presents her goal as noble and important ("I long to save lives..."). This distractor incorrectly projects the meaning of "curiosity" onto the narrator's internal feelings about herself, rather than her observation of the outside world.

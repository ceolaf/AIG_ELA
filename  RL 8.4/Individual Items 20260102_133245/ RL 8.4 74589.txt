### Rationales

**Option A: It disappears completely and can never be found again.**

- This goes too far. The narrator says the approval “recedes in the distance,” which suggests it is moving away, not vanishing forever.
- The tone of the passage shows she still hopes to gain Dr. Blackwell’s respect; it has not “disappeared completely.”

**Option B: It moves farther away and becomes harder to reach.***  

- “Recedes” literally means to move back or farther away.
- The figurative use here compares Dr. Blackwell’s approval to something that keeps slipping farther out of reach the harder the narrator tries.
- This meaning supports the discouraged, frustrated tone in the paragraph, showing how her goal feels increasingly distant.

**Option C: It changes shape into something unfamiliar.**

- Nothing in the sentence suggests that the approval is changing its form or nature.
- The phrase “in the distance” signals movement away, not transformation.

**Option D: It returns to where it started.**

- “Recedes” does not mean “returns”; it means to move back from a point, not to go back to an original starting place.
- The metaphor focuses on distance growing, not on going back to a beginning.

Tier 7a (GPT) #2 (temp=0.8)

2. Read this sentence from the passage:

   “If I was hoping to find a **motherly figure** in Dr. Blackwell, I was quickly **disabused** of that notion.”

   How do the words “motherly figure” and “disabused” work together to shape the meaning and tone of this sentence?

   A. They show that the narrator has decided Dr. Blackwell is too old to be a real mentor.  
   *B. They contrast the narrator’s wish for gentle comfort with the harsh reality of Dr. Blackwell’s strictness, creating a disappointed tone.*  
   C. They suggest that Dr. Blackwell has replaced the narrator’s actual mother, adding a warm, affectionate tone.  
   D. They indicate that the narrator no longer wants any guidance from Dr. Blackwell, creating a rebellious tone.

**Rationales**

**Option A:**  
- Misinterprets “motherly figure” as mainly about age instead of emotional qualities (kindness, gentleness, nurturing).  
- “Disabused” means the narrator was corrected or had a mistaken belief taken away, not that she decided Dr. Blackwell was “too old.”  
- Does not capture the emotional contrast between expectation and reality.

**Option B (KEY):**  
- “Motherly figure” connotes warmth, protection, and gentle support—what the narrator *hoped* for.  
- “Disabused” suggests that this comforting idea was firmly taken away, often in a somewhat harsh or abrupt way.  
- Together, these words highlight a sharp contrast between the narrator’s expectations and Dr. Blackwell’s strict, critical behavior.  
- This contrast creates a tone of disappointment and emotional letdown, which aligns with the narrator’s feelings in the paragraph.

**Option C:**  
- Claims the words imply that Dr. Blackwell *has* become like a mother, but the sentence says the opposite: the narrator was “disabused” of that hope.  
- Misreads the tone as “warm, affectionate” when the actual tone is more disappointed and sober.  
- Ignores the negative connotation of “disabused,” which undercuts the “motherly” idea.

**Option D:**  
- Overstates the narrator’s reaction; she still desperately wants Dr. Blackwell’s approval and guidance.  
- “Disabused” refers to losing an illusion about *what kind* of mentor Dr. Blackwell is, not rejecting her mentorship altogether.  
- Introduces a “rebellious” tone that is not present in the passage at this point.

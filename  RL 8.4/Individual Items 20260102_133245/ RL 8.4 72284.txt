**Item:**

In the passage, the narrator states that Dr. Blackwell's approval "recedes in the distance" the more she seeks it. What does this phrase suggest about the narrator's struggle?

A. Dr. Blackwell is physically moving farther away from the narrator during their interactions.

B. The narrator needs to get eyeglasses because she cannot see Dr. Blackwell clearly.

*C. The narrator's efforts to impress Dr. Blackwell seem to make success feel increasingly unattainable.

D. Dr. Blackwell is planning to move her office to a location farther from the narrator's workspace.

**Rationales:**

**Option A:** This response interprets the phrase literally, focusing on physical distance rather than recognizing the metaphorical meaning. A student selecting this option likely misses how the author uses spatial imagery to represent an emotional and professional relationship. They fail to understand that "distance" here refers to the gap between the narrator's current performance and her goal of earning approval.

**Option B:** This response also takes a literal approach to the visual imagery in the phrase but misattributes the problem to the narrator's eyesight rather than understanding the figurative meaning. A student choosing this option likely recognizes that "recedes in the distance" involves vision and distance but doesn't grasp how these elements work metaphorically to describe the narrator's frustration with her elusive goal.

**Option C (Key):** This response correctly identifies the figurative meaning of the phrase. The metaphor of something "receding in the distance" suggests that despite the narrator's efforts—or perhaps because of them—her goal of earning Dr. Blackwell's approval seems to become more difficult to achieve. The spatial imagery effectively conveys the narrator's sense of futility and growing desperation as her attempts to succeed appear to backfire, making her objective feel increasingly out of reach.

**Option D:** This response focuses on a literal interpretation involving physical relocation of an office space. A student selecting this option completely misses the metaphorical nature of the language and doesn't recognize how the author uses the concept of distance to represent the emotional and professional gap between the narrator's current standing and her desired relationship with Dr. Blackwell.

### Rationales

**Correct Answer: B***  
- “Disabused of that notion” is figurative; ideas are not literally “abused.” It means having a mistaken belief taken away.  
- In context, the mistaken belief is that Dr. Blackwell would be a “motherly figure.”  
- The word “quickly” plus “disabused” carries a sharp, abrupt connotation, suggesting the narrator’s comforting expectation was firmly overturned.  
- This creates a tone of disappointment and a hint of bitterness, because the narrator wanted warmth and received strictness instead.

**A.**  
- Misreads the connotation of “disabused,” which does not suggest gentle guidance or gratitude; it suggests being corrected, often abruptly or firmly.  
- The surrounding context (“she thought nothing of reprimanding me in front of all the other students”) supports a more negative emotional response, not admiration.

**C.**  
- Contradicts the text. The phrase “If I was hoping to find a motherly figure…” shows that the narrator *did* hold that hope.  
- Being “disabused” means the belief was real and then removed, not that it never really existed.  
- The tone here is not mainly doubtful or uncertain; it is more about realizing an unwelcome truth.

**D.**  
- Overstates the narrator’s reaction. The passage portrays Dr. Blackwell as strict and critical, but not as outright cruel.  
- “Disabused of that notion” focuses on losing an illusion, not on accusing Dr. Blackwell of being unkind.  
- This answer projects a harsher judgment than the text supports and mischaracterizes the tone as mainly angry and condemning.

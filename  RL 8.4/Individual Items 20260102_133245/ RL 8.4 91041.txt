### Rationales

**Option A: She expected Dr. Blackwell to act as a gentle guide who would comfort and protect her.*  
- “Motherly” has connotations of warmth, care, patience, and protection.  
- A “motherly figure” suggests someone who guides, nurtures, and supports.  
- This fits the narrator’s disappointment: she hoped for gentle support but instead receives public scoldings.

**Option B: She expected Dr. Blackwell to treat her as an equal colleague and close friend.**  
- “Motherly” does not usually imply equality or friendship; it implies a more experienced person caring for someone younger or less experienced.  
- The passage emphasizes guidance and approval, not equality.

**Option C: She expected Dr. Blackwell to ignore her mistakes and let her work independently.**  
- A “motherly” figure would likely correct mistakes, though gently, rather than ignore them.  
- The narrator’s problem is not that Dr. Blackwell corrects her, but that she does so harshly and publicly.

**Option D: She expected Dr. Blackwell to behave in a strict, distant, and unemotional way.**  
- These traits are the opposite of the usual connotations of “motherly.”  
- The sentence shows she is “disabused” of her hope when Dr. Blackwell behaves more strictly than she expected, which means the original expectation was something warmer and more supportive.

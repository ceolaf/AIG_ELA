What is the main effect of the author’s choice of the word **extinguish**?

A. It suggests that Diana’s hopes are like a fragile flame that could be snuffed out completely. *
B. It implies that Dr. Blackwell is deliberately trying to crush Diana’s spirit with her harsh treatment.
C. It shows that Diana’s passion for medicine is fiery and perhaps difficult for her to control.
D. It emphasizes that Diana has very little hope left and is about to give up on her dream.

**Rationales**

**A. (Key):** The word "extinguish" literally means to put out a fire or a light. By using this word figuratively, the author creates a metaphor that compares Diana’s hope to a flame. This choice emphasizes both the vitality of her hope (like a living flame) and its vulnerability. The word implies a sudden, complete, and final end to her dream, as if a light were being snuffed out, leaving only darkness. This accurately captures the dramatic and total nature of the potential failure.

**B. (Distractor):** This option attributes intent to Dr. Blackwell that is not supported by the word choice or the passage. "Extinguish" describes the *effect* on Diana’s hopes if she fails; it does not describe Dr. Blackwell's motivation. While Diana feels Dr. Blackwell is harsh, the passage as a whole suggests Dr. Blackwell is testing her, not maliciously trying to crush her spirit.

**C. (Distractor):** This option misinterprets the metaphor. The use of "extinguish" portrays Diana's hope as something precious and vulnerable that needs to be protected, not as a wild or uncontrolled fire. The focus is on the threat of the hope being put out, rather than on the nature of the passion itself.

**D. (Distractor):** This option is an overstatement and misreads Diana’s character. The word "extinguish" describes a potential future event—what *would* happen if she were sent away. It highlights the high stakes of her situation. However, in the present moment of the narrative, she is determined to "somehow manage to do better," indicating she has not yet given up and still holds onto her hope.

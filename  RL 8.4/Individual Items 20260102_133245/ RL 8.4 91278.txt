**Item**

Read this sentence from paragraph 9.

> Once again, I felt unjustly reprimanded, like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar.

What is the primary effect of the simile in this sentence?

A. It emphasizes that Diana feels her behavior was minor and that Dr. Blackwell’s response was overly harsh. *
B. It suggests that Diana knows she has broken an important rule and is ashamed of her actions.
C. It reveals that Diana views Dr. Blackwell as a mother figure who is teaching her right from wrong.
D. It illustrates Diana’s general lack of confidence and her fear of making any kind of mistake.

**Rationales**

*   **A. (Key):** The student correctly analyzes the effect of the simile. Comparing her situation to a child being caught sneaking sweets implies that the "crime" (making "idle conversation") was minor and harmless. The feeling of being "unjustly reprimanded" for such a small thing highlights her perception that Dr. Blackwell's sharp response was disproportionate and unfair, establishing a tone of belittlement and injustice.

*   **B. (Distractor):** The student makes a literal interpretation of being "caught" without considering the context. While being caught does imply doing something wrong, the specific comparison to "sneaking sweets" and the narrator's explicit feeling of being "unjustly reprimanded" indicate that she does not believe her action warranted such a severe reaction. Therefore, she does not see it as breaking an "important rule."

*   **C. (Distractor):** The student misinterprets the nature of the relationship described in the passage. Although the simile involves a "child," the tone is not one of gentle, parental correction. In paragraph 4, Diana explicitly states she was "disabused of that notion" that Dr. Blackwell might be a "motherly figure." The simile reinforces the idea that Dr. Blackwell is a harsh authority figure, not a nurturing one.

*   **D. (Distractor):** The student identifies a correct general character trait but fails to connect it to the specific function of the simile. While it is true that Diana lacks confidence, the primary effect of this specific simile is not to restate that general feeling. Instead, it is to characterize this particular interaction, focusing on Diana's sense of injustice and the feeling that she is being treated like a small child over a trivial matter, rather than her overall fear of failure.

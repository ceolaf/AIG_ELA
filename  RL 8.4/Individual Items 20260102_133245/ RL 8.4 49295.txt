Here is another unique multiple-choice item written to the specifications provided.

**Item**

Read this sentence from paragraph 4.

> If I was hoping to find a motherly figure in Dr. Blackwell, I was quickly disabused of that notion.

How does the phrase “disabused of that notion” affect the tone of the paragraph?

A. It creates a confused tone by suggesting the narrator is unsure of what Dr. Blackwell expects.
B. It develops a resentful tone by implying the narrator feels Dr. Blackwell is being deliberately unkind.
C. It establishes a formal tone that minimizes the narrator’s disappointment in her new mentor.
*D. It contributes to a frank tone that emphasizes the harsh reality of the narrator’s situation.

**Rationales**

*   **A. Rationale:** This option is incorrect. The phrase “disabused of that notion” indicates a moment of sudden, clear understanding, not confusion. The narrator is no longer mistaken about Dr. Blackwell’s personality; she sees it clearly. A student might choose this if they do not understand the meaning of the phrase and interpret it as a source of confusion.
*   **B. Rationale:** This option is incorrect. While the narrator may feel some resentment later, this specific phrase does not imply that Dr. Blackwell’s actions are deliberately cruel. “Disabused” means to be corrected of a wrong idea. The phrase focuses on the narrator’s realization and the correction of her own mistaken hope, not on assigning malicious intent to Dr. Blackwell.
*   **C. Rationale:** This option is incorrect. Although the language is formal, its effect is to heighten, not minimize, the narrator’s disappointment. The formal, stark phrase contrasts sharply with the warm, gentle expectation of a “motherly figure,” thereby emphasizing how completely and coldly her hope was shattered.
*   **D. Rationale:** This is the correct answer. The phrase is a formal and direct way of saying the narrator was forced to face the truth. This word choice creates a frank, matter-of-fact tone that reflects the stark contrast between the narrator's hopes for a warm mentor and the harsh reality of Dr. Blackwell's demanding personality. It underscores the severity of the narrator's realization without sentimentality.

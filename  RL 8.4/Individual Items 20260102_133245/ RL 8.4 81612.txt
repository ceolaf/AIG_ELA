### **Rationales**

**A. (Correct Answer)** This option accurately analyzes the connotative meaning of "extinguish." The word literally means to put out a fire, which implies a complete and final end. By using this metaphor, the author creates a despairing and dramatic tone, emphasizing the finality of the failure Diana fears. It conveys that her hopes would not just be diminished but completely eliminated, which is a powerful and impactful choice. This requires a student to understand how figurative language affects tone.

**B. (Distractor)** This option offers an interpretation that is too weak for the word "extinguish." Words like "delay" or "postpone" would create a cautious tone, but "extinguish" implies a permanent end, not a temporary pause. This distractor targets students who may recognize the negative connotation of the word but fail to grasp its intensity and finality.

**C. (Distractor)** This option focuses on a plausible emotion (frustration) but misinterprets the specific meaning of "extinguish." While Diana might feel frustrated, the word "extinguish" itself does not primarily convey a sense of unfairness. Its main impact is on the totality and permanence of the loss, which leads to a feeling of despair or hopelessness, not just frustration over injustice.

**D. (Distractor)** This option incorrectly interprets the character's state of mind. The word "extinguish" describes a potential future event—the destruction of her hopes if she is sent away. It does not suggest that she is currently reconsidering or reflecting on her goals; rather, it highlights her fear of losing them entirely, which reinforces her determination to succeed. A reflective tone would be created by more contemplative language, not a word as intense as "extinguish."

### **Rationales**

**A. (Correct Answer)** This option correctly interprets the connotative meaning of the simile. A child "sneaking sweets" is committing a very minor offense. By comparing her situation to this, Diana implies that her action—speaking soothingly to a patient—was also minor and did not warrant a sharp scolding. The comparison to a "child" also highlights her feeling of being treated in a condescending or belittling manner, which is reinforced by the text stating she felt "unjustly reprimanded." This analysis requires the student to understand how the figurative language impacts the tone and meaning of the sentence.

**B. (Distractor)** This option represents a literal misinterpretation of the simile. Figurative language creates a comparison to explain a current feeling or situation; it does not necessarily mean the narrator is literally recalling a past event. The text provides no evidence that Diana is thinking about her actual childhood. This distractor targets students who may not understand the function of a simile.

**C. (Distractor)** This option misinterprets the central idea conveyed by the simile and directly contradicts the text. The text explicitly states Diana felt "unjustly reprimanded," indicating she does not believe the punishment fits the crime. The simile reinforces this by comparing her action to something trivial ("sneaking sweets"), not a "serious distraction." Students who choose this option may recognize the feeling of being caught but fail to analyze the nuance of injustice conveyed by the specific words chosen.

**D. (Distractor)** This option presents a feeling that is true for the character in the broader context of the passage but is not the specific meaning of this particular simile. Diana does worry about gaining Dr. Blackwell's approval and being sent away (as seen in paragraph 5). However, the simile in paragraph 9 is specifically about the feeling of injustice and embarrassment in that single moment. This is a challenging distractor that requires students to focus precisely on the impact of the specific word choice cited in the question rather than on the character's general emotional state.

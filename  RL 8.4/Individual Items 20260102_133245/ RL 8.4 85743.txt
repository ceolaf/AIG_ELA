### Rationales

**Option C (Correct):**  
- “Disabused of that notion” is a figurative phrase meaning to be shown that a belief is false.  
- In context, the narrator expected Dr. Blackwell to be “a motherly figure,” but then describes being publicly reprimanded on the first day and scolded daily afterward.  
- These details show that she quickly learns her assumption was incorrect, so the phrase means she was corrected and made to realize the idea was wrong.

**Option A (Distractor):**  
- Says she was encouraged to *keep* believing the idea, which is the opposite of “disabused.”  
- The harsh public reprimands and repeated scoldings clearly do not support the idea that Dr. Blackwell is motherly.

**Option B (Distractor):**  
- Suggests the idea was “improved,” not rejected.  
- The sentence signals a complete change of belief, not a revision or improvement; “disabused” implies being freed from a false belief, not modifying it.

**Option D (Distractor):**  
- Implies praise, which does not match the tone or events.  
- The narrator describes feeling “unjustly reprimanded, like a child,” which indicates criticism, not secret approval or praise.

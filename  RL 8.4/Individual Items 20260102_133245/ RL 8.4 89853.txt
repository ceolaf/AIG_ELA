Tier 7b (Gemini) #2 (temp=0.8)

Read this sentence from paragraph 7.

> Female physicians are still more of a **curiosity** than anything.

What does the narrator’s use of the word “curiosity” mainly reveal about her perspective?

A. It shows her belief that female doctors are more inquisitive and eager to learn than male doctors are.
B. It suggests her concern that patients will ask too many personal questions instead of focusing on their health.
C. It implies her frustration that people are more interested in the novelty of female doctors than in their skills.
*D. It emphasizes her view that female doctors are regarded as strange and unusual rather than as capable professionals.

---
**Rationales:**

*   **Key (D):** The correct response. This option accurately interprets the connotative meaning of "curiosity" in this context. The narrator is not using the word to mean "a desire to learn." Instead, she is using its other meaning: an object that is novel, strange, or interesting. By calling female physicians a "curiosity," she is highlighting her perspective that society views them as an oddity or a spectacle, not yet as legitimate, respected medical professionals. This directly addresses the impact of the word choice on meaning and tone, as required by RL.8.4.

*   **Distractor (A):** This is incorrect. This distractor relies on the most common, literal definition of "curiosity" (being inquisitive) but fails to consider the context of the sentence and paragraph. The narrator is discussing how patients and society view female doctors, not the doctors' own desire to learn. This represents a failure to analyze the word's meaning *as it is used in the text*.

*   **Distractor (B):** This is incorrect. This option misinterprets the focus of the word. The sentence states that the doctors *are* a curiosity, not that the patients *have* curiosity that manifests as intrusive questions. While patients might be curious, the narrator's word choice is making a broader point about the doctors' social and professional status, not a specific complaint about patient behavior.

*   **Distractor (C):** This is a plausible but less precise option than the key. While the narrator is certainly frustrated and people are interested in the "novelty" of female doctors, the word "curiosity" carries a stronger connotation of being seen as strange or an oddity. Option (D) more accurately captures the full weight of the word choice, which implies not just novelty but a lack of professional standing, framing them as "strange and unusual" rather than simply "new." Therefore, (D) is the more precise and complete analysis of the word's impact. **(Note for item developers: This distractor was intentionally made strong to increase the item's difficulty and ensure students are selecting the *best* analysis, a common feature of high-quality assessment items. However, D remains superior because "strange and unusual" more directly captures the specific connotation of being a "curiosity" in this historical context than the more general term "novelty.")**

**Revised Final Version:**

To improve the distinction between C and D and make the key more definitively correct, I will revise option C to be more clearly incorrect.

*   **Distractor (C):** This is incorrect. This option assigns a positive, optimistic motivation to the narrator's word choice that is not supported by the text. The narrator's tone in this paragraph is one of concern and realism about the challenges female doctors face ("I am still not sure our patients are as confident in our abilities..."). Using "curiosity" is a way of describing a problem, not expressing hope for a positive outcome.

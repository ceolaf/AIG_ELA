**Rationales:**

*   **A. (Key):** The student correctly analyzes the figurative language. The simile compares being reprimanded by Dr. Blackwell to a child being caught doing something minor and forbidden, like "sneaking sweets." This comparison emphasizes Diana's feeling that the scolding is disproportionate to her action (comforting a patient) and that she is being treated in a condescending, childish manner, which supports the text's claim that she felt "unjustly reprimanded."

*   **B. (Distractor):** The student may have focused on the word "child" to mean inexperienced. While Diana is an apprentice, the simile's purpose is not to express humility but to convey her frustration and embarrassment at being unfairly scolded. The tone is one of indignation, not self-reflection on her need for more training.

*   **C. (Distractor):** The student likely focused on the words "caught" and "sneaking," which suggest wrongdoing, but ignored the key phrase "unjustly reprimanded." The text explicitly states that Diana believes the reprimand is unfair, which contradicts the idea that she feels genuine guilt for her actions.

*   **D. (Distractor):** The student may have been misled by the patient's sympathetic look mentioned in the next sentence. However, the simile itself describes Diana's internal emotional response to Dr. Blackwell's actions, not her concern about her professional image in the eyes of the patient. The focus of the comparison is on the dynamic between Diana and her mentor.

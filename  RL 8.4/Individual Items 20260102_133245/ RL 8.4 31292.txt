### Rationales

**Option B (Correct):**  
- “Recedes” means to move back or away.  
- In context, the narrator is repeatedly scolded and feels she “can do nothing right,” so using “recedes” makes Dr. Blackwell’s approval feel like something that keeps moving farther out of reach.  
- This contributes to a frustrated, discouraged tone.

**Option A (Distractor):**  
- “Recedes” suggests moving away, not “approaching.”  
- This directly contradicts the image in the sentence and ignores the negative context of her failures.

**Option C (Distractor):**  
- A “calm” tone would fit a neutral or stable image, but “recedes” implies ongoing loss or retreat.  
- The narrator is anxious about being sent away, not calm.

**Option D (Distractor):**  
- Nothing in the passage suggests a playful or joking situation.  
- The comparison to approval moving away is serious and discouraging, not lighthearted “teasing.”

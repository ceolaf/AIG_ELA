### Rationales

**A. To repair injured bodies and restore people to health.*  
- Correct: captures the figurative meaning in context.  
- “Broken” does not literally mean shattered objects; it refers to people harmed by illness or injury.  
- “Whole again” suggests restoring them to full health, matching the narrator’s earlier wish to “save lives” and “find cures for diseases.”  

**B. To fix damaged medical tools so they can be reused.**  
- Plausible if “broken” is read literally, but the surrounding phrases (“save lives,” “find cures for diseases”) focus on patients, not equipment.  
- Does not fit the figurative, patient-centered tone of the sentence.

**C. To reunite families that were separated by the war.**  
- Reflects a possible emotional sense of “broken,” but the passage here is specifically about medical work.  
- The narrator speaks as a nurse/aspiring doctor, so her goal is about health, not family relationships.

**D. To rebuild hospitals that were destroyed in battles.**  
- Misreads “broken” as buildings.  
- The sentence lists actions doctors perform on people, not construction projects on places.

---

### Rationales

**A. It becomes less important to the narrator over time.**  
- Misinterpretation of connotation.  
- In context, the narrator is obsessed with Dr. Blackwell’s approval; it is not becoming less important. The phrase “the more I seek her approval” shows it is very important to her.

**B. It moves farther away from the narrator, as if she can never quite reach it.*  
- Correct: interprets the figurative meaning.  
- “Recedes in the distance” uses spatial language to describe an emotional/psychological experience: the approval feels like a goal that keeps moving away the harder she tries.  
- This captures both the literal sense of “recede” (to move back or farther away) and the figurative impact on tone (frustration, discouragement).

**C. It disappears completely from the narrator’s thoughts.**  
- Incorrect because the sentence does not say approval disappears; it says it “recedes,” suggesting it is still there but harder to reach.  
- The narrator’s continued worry about being sent away shows she is still thinking about it.

**D. It is taken away from the narrator by other students.**  
- Adds an idea not supported by the text.  
- Nothing in the passage suggests that other students are “taking” approval from her; the sentence focuses on her own efforts and feelings, not on competition.

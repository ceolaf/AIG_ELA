> “If I was hoping to find a **motherly figure** in Dr. Blackwell, I was quickly disabused of that notion.”

What is the effect of the phrase “motherly figure” on the tone of this sentence?

A. It makes the tone humorous by suggesting Diana expected Dr. Blackwell to joke with her.  
B. It makes the tone bitter by showing that Diana now dislikes Dr. Blackwell.  
C. It makes the tone wistful by revealing Diana’s desire for warmth and gentle support.*  
D. It makes the tone fearful by suggesting that Diana is afraid of older women.  

**Correct Answer: C. It makes the tone wistful by revealing Diana’s desire for warmth and gentle support.*  

**Rationales**

- **A. It makes the tone humorous by suggesting Diana expected Dr. Blackwell to joke with her.**  
  Incorrect. “Motherly” suggests kindness, guidance, and protection, not joking. Nothing in the sentence indicates humor; instead, it shows disappointment.

- **B. It makes the tone bitter by showing that Diana now dislikes Dr. Blackwell.**  
  Incorrect. The narrator does not say she dislikes Dr. Blackwell; she is disappointed that Dr. Blackwell is not as gentle as she hoped. The tone is more sad and reflective than angry or bitter.

- **C. It makes the tone wistful by revealing Diana’s desire for warmth and gentle support.*  
  Correct. Calling Dr. Blackwell a hoped-for “motherly figure” shows that Diana longed for nurturing guidance, and the phrase “I was quickly disabused of that notion” shows that this hope was not fulfilled. This combination creates a wistful, regretful tone.

- **D. It makes the tone fearful by suggesting that Diana is afraid of older women.**  
  Incorrect. The sentence does not express fear of older women; instead, it focuses on what Diana hoped Dr. Blackwell would be like emotionally (caring and supportive) and the disappointment when she is not.

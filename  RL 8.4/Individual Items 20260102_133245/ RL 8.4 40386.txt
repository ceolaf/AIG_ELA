### Rationales

**Option A:**  
- Misinterprets the figurative phrase. “Recedes in the distance” suggests something moving away, not something getting closer.  
- This would create a discouraging, not hopeful, feeling.  
- Does not fit the narrator’s worried, insecure state in this part of the passage.

**Option B (Correct):**  
- “Recedes in the distance” is used figuratively to compare Dr. Blackwell’s approval to a goal that keeps moving farther away the more the narrator tries to reach it.  
- This image adds a tone of frustration and discouragement: the narrator feels that her efforts only make success feel less attainable.  
- Aligns with the context: she feels self-conscious, repeatedly scolded, and afraid she will be sent away.

**Option C:**  
- Treats the phrase as if it were literal and physical (how far away the doctor is standing), which it is not.  
- There is nothing humorous in this moment; the narrator feels “unjustly reprimanded” and worried about her future.  
- Misreads both the figurative language and the tone.

**Option D:**  
- Directly contradicts the sentence, which shows she cares very deeply about Dr. Blackwell’s approval (“the more I seek her approval”).  
- “Recedes in the distance” emphasizes her concern and disappointment, not relaxation or indifference.  
- Ignores the anxious tone running through this section of the passage.

***

**Rationales**

*   **A. Rationale:** This option incorrectly interprets the word "curiosity" by focusing on its denotative meaning related to a desire to know or ask questions. In the context of the sentence, the word is used to describe *what* female physicians are, not what they inspire in others.
*   **B. Rationale:** This option makes an unsupported inference. While something that is a "curiosity" might attract attention, the word's primary function here is to describe the social perception of female doctors, not the popularity or fame of the clinic itself.
*   **C. Rationale (Key):** This is the correct answer. The student must understand the connotative meaning of "curiosity" as an unusual or strange object that one might stare at. By using this word, the author highlights the societal prejudice of the time; female doctors were not yet seen as legitimate and normal professionals but as oddities, which diminished their professional standing.
*   **D. Rationale:** This option contradicts the meaning implied by the word "curiosity." The word suggests a sense of distance and observation, treating the doctors as objects. This is the opposite of the comfort and familiarity this option suggests. The narrator does mention that some patients are more comfortable, but that is a separate point and not the meaning conveyed by this specific word choice.

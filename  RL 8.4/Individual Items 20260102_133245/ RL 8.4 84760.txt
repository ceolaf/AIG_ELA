Tier 6a (Claude) #2 (temp=0.8)

Here is a different multiple choice item aligned to RL.8.4:

**Item:**

In the passage, the narrator describes feeling "like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar" after being reprimanded by Dr. Blackwell. What does this comparison reveal about how the narrator perceives Dr. Blackwell's treatment of her?

A. The narrator believes Dr. Blackwell is trying to teach her proper medical procedures.

*B. The narrator feels she is being treated as someone who has done something wrong and shameful, even when her actions were well-intentioned.

C. The narrator thinks Dr. Blackwell sees her as someone who cannot follow the rules of the clinic.

D. The narrator realizes she needs to ask permission before speaking to patients.

**Rationales:**

**Option A:** This response focuses on the educational aspect of the situation but misses the emotional impact of the specific comparison the author chose. While Dr. Blackwell may indeed be teaching, the simile "like a child caught sneaking sweets" carries connotations of shame, guilt, and unfair punishment that go beyond simple instruction. Students choosing this option are not recognizing the figurative language's emotional undertones.

**Option B (Key):** This response correctly interprets the figurative meaning of the comparison. The image of "a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar" evokes feelings of shame, embarrassment, and being caught doing something wrong, even though the action (sneaking sweets) is relatively innocent. This mirrors the narrator's situation—she was trying to comfort a patient (a well-intentioned act) but feels unjustly shamed. The word choice emphasizes the narrator's sense that the punishment doesn't fit the "crime" and highlights her feeling of being treated unfairly.

**Option C:** This interpretation is too literal and focuses on rule-following rather than capturing the emotional weight of the comparison. While the simile involves a child breaking rules, the key insight is about the shame and disproportionate guilt the narrator feels, not simply about her ability to follow clinic procedures.

**Option D:** This response treats the comparison too practically and misses the figurative meaning entirely. The simile isn't meant to suggest a literal lesson about asking permission, but rather to convey the narrator's emotional state of feeling unfairly shamed and childlike in her embarrassment.

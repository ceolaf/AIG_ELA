### Rationales

**A. It becomes less important to her over time.**  
- This choice focuses on importance, not distance.  
- In the sentence, “farther it recedes in the distance” creates an image of approval moving away, not becoming less important.  
- A student choosing this may focus on the emotional idea that approval “matters less,” but that is not what the figurative language conveys.

**B. It moves farther away from her reach.*  
- “Recedes in the distance” is figurative language suggesting that the approval she wants feels like it is moving away from her as she tries to get it.  
- “Recedes” literally means “moves back” or “withdraws,” and here it describes her approval feeling less attainable.  
- This option captures both the literal sense (moving back) and the connotative, emotional meaning (harder to achieve).

**C. It completely disappears from her life.**  
- “Recedes” suggests something is going away or becoming more distant, not instantly vanishing.  
- Nothing in the passage says Dr. Blackwell’s approval is gone forever; it just feels harder to get.  
- Students might pick this if they overstate the word’s meaning.

**D. It changes into something different.**  
- This confuses “recedes” with “transforms” or “evolves.”  
- In the sentence, approval is still approval; it doesn’t change into something else. It only feels farther away.  
- This option does not match the image of something “in the distance.”

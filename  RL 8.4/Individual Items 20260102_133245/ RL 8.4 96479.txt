**Multiple Choice Item**

In the passage, when Diana describes Dr. Blackwell's approval as something that "recedes in the distance," the author's word choice creates the effect of:

A. Suggesting that Diana needs to walk faster to catch up with her mentor
*B. Emphasizing how Diana's efforts seem to push her goal further away
C. Indicating that Dr. Blackwell is physically moving away from Diana
D. Showing that Diana's eyesight is getting worse under stress

**Rationales:**

**Option A:** This response demonstrates a literal interpretation of "recedes in the distance" as a physical action requiring a physical solution. A student choosing this option recognizes the spatial imagery but misses the figurative meaning entirely. They haven't grasped how the author uses this phrase to convey the psychological and emotional experience of pursuing something that becomes more elusive with effort.

**Option B (Correct Answer):** This response shows sophisticated understanding of how the author's word choice creates meaning beyond the literal. "Recedes in the distance" typically describes something moving away as you try to approach it—like a mirage or horizon. Applied to approval, this creates a powerful sense of frustration and irony: the harder Diana tries, the more unattainable her goal becomes. The word choice establishes a tone of mounting desperation and captures the psychological reality that anxiety can make us perform worse, creating a self-defeating cycle.

**Option C:** This response focuses on the literal, physical meaning of the words rather than their figurative application. While "recedes in the distance" could describe someone walking away, in this context it's describing an abstract concept (approval), not Dr. Blackwell's physical location. A student selecting this option hasn't recognized that the phrase is being used metaphorically to describe an emotional and professional dynamic.

**Option D:** This response completely misinterprets the figurative language by suggesting a medical/physical problem with Diana's vision. This shows a failure to recognize that "recedes in the distance" is being used as a metaphor for the elusiveness of achieving Dr. Blackwell's approval. The student has missed both the figurative nature of the language and the emotional context in which it appears.

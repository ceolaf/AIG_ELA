**Item**

Read this sentence from the end of paragraph 4.

> It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance.

What is the main effect of the phrase “recedes in the distance”?

A. It conveys Diana’s growing sense of hopelessness that she will ever be able to please Dr. Blackwell. *
B. It implies that Dr. Blackwell is a remote and emotionally unavailable person.
C. It suggests that Diana has decided to stop trying to win Dr. Blackwell’s approval.
D. It shows that Diana thinks Dr. Blackwell's standards are high but ultimately achievable.

**Rationales**

*   **A. (Key):** The student correctly analyzes the figurative language. The phrase creates a metaphor that compares approval to a physical object or destination. For this destination to "recede" means it moves farther away as one tries to approach it. This effectively communicates Diana's feeling that her efforts are futile and her goal is becoming increasingly impossible, which creates a tone of hopelessness.

*   **B. (Distractor):** The student identifies a plausible character trait for Dr. Blackwell but misses the primary function of this specific phrase. While Dr. Blackwell might be described as remote, the phrase "recedes in the distance" focuses on the *dynamic* of Diana’s struggle and the perceived outcome of her actions, rather than on a static description of Dr. Blackwell's personality. The effect is centered on Diana's emotional state.

*   **C. (Distractor):** The student misinterprets the meaning of the phrase in the context of Diana’s actions. The sentence describes the ongoing result of Diana's efforts ("the more I seek"), not a decision to give up. The feeling of hopelessness comes from her continued but unsuccessful attempts, as shown in the next paragraph where she resolves she "must somehow manage to do better."

*   **D. (Distractor):** The student misunderstands the meaning of the word "recedes." To recede means to move back or farther away. This word choice indicates that the goal is becoming *less* achievable, not that it is difficult but possible. This option presents a meaning that is the opposite of what the figurative language conveys.

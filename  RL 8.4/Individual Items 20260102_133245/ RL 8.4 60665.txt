**Multiple Choice Item**

In the passage, when Diana describes feeling "like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar" after Dr. Blackwell's reprimand, this comparison reveals that Diana experiences the scolding as

A. unfair punishment that makes her feel ashamed and diminished
B. a necessary correction that will help her improve her skills
C. *both guilty and innocent at the same time, creating inner conflict*
D. evidence that Dr. Blackwell treats her students too harshly

**Rationales:**

**A. unfair punishment that makes her feel ashamed and diminished**
This distractor captures Diana's sense of being "unjustly reprimanded" but misses the deeper connotative meaning of the specific analogy. While Diana does feel ashamed, the comparison to "sneaking sweets" suggests something more complex than simple unfairness—it implies a misdeed that feels both wrong and innocent simultaneously. This response doesn't recognize how the analogy creates internal contradiction in Diana's emotional experience.

**B. a necessary correction that will help her improve her skills**
This distractor completely misreads the connotative meaning of the analogy by suggesting acceptance of the correction. The comparison to "sneaking sweets" doesn't suggest learning or improvement, but rather captures a feeling of being caught in something that feels simultaneously naughty and harmless. This response ignores the emotional complexity the analogy creates and focuses on a literal interpretation of workplace feedback.

**C. *both guilty and innocent at the same time, creating inner conflict* (CORRECT)**
This option correctly identifies how the analogy works connotatively in this context. "Sneaking sweets" suggests a minor transgression—something that feels wrong but is essentially innocent and natural. This creates the psychological tension Diana experiences: she feels guilty for being reprimanded yet knows her compassionate behavior toward the patient was appropriate and kind. The analogy captures her conflicted emotional state and contributes to a tone of frustrated confusion about Dr. Blackwell's expectations.

**D. evidence that Dr. Blackwell treats her students too harshly**
This distractor shifts focus away from Diana's internal experience to making a judgment about Dr. Blackwell's behavior. The analogy of "sneaking sweets" is about Diana's subjective emotional response, not an objective assessment of her mentor's teaching methods. This response fails to recognize that the comparison reveals Diana's psychological state rather than commenting on Dr. Blackwell's appropriateness as a teacher.

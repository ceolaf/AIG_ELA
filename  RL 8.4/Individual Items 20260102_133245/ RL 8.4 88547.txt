### Rationales

**A. (Distractor):** This option incorrectly assigns agency to Dr. Blackwell within the metaphor. The figurative language focuses on the narrator's perception of "approval" as a goal that is moving away from her. While Dr. Blackwell's actions cause this feeling, the phrase itself describes the effect on the narrator (the goal seems impossible) rather than the doctor's specific intent to make things harder.

**B. (Distractor):** This option misinterprets the narrator's emotional state. The sentence conveys frustration and a sense of futility, but the narrator's actions and thoughts in the surrounding paragraphs show she is still highly motivated. In the very next paragraph, she says, "I must somehow manage to do better...and gain the doctor's respect." This indicates her motivation remains strong despite her discouragement.

**C. (Key):** The student correctly analyzes the metaphor. The image of a destination that "recedes in the distance" as one walks toward it is a powerful way to express a futile or impossible effort. By applying this image to gaining Dr. Blackwell's approval, the narrator emphasizes her growing despair and her belief that no matter how hard she tries, she will never reach her goal.

**D. (Distractor):** This option represents a literal and incorrect interpretation of the figurative language. The phrase "recedes in the distance" is used metaphorically to describe the narrator's emotional and professional struggle, not a physical distance between her and Dr. Blackwell. Students who choose this option are not recognizing the non-literal meaning of the phrase.

**Multiple Choice Item**

In the passage, when Diana says she was "disabused of that notion," the author's word choice suggests that Diana's expectation of finding a motherly figure was

A. gently corrected through patient guidance
B. *harshly stripped away through unpleasant reality
C. gradually modified through honest conversation
D. temporarily challenged but ultimately fulfilled

**Rationales:**

**A. gently corrected through patient guidance**
This option misses the harsh connotative meaning of "disabused" and focuses on a more neutral interpretation of correction. A student selecting this might understand that Diana's expectation was wrong but fails to recognize how the author's specific word choice conveys the abrupt and unpleasant nature of this realization. The formal, clinical tone of "disabused" suggests something much more severe than gentle correction, especially when contrasted with softer alternatives the author could have chosen like "corrected" or "shown."

**B. *harshly stripped away through unpleasant reality** (KEY)
This option correctly identifies how "disabused" carries connotative weight beyond simple correction. The author deliberately chose this formal, somewhat harsh word rather than gentler alternatives to emphasize the abrupt and unpleasant way Diana's romantic expectations were destroyed. The prefix "dis-" suggests removal or reversal, while "abused" (even in this context) carries undertones of rough treatment. This word choice reinforces the tone of disappointment and reflects how Dr. Blackwell's stern, professional demeanor brutally eliminated Diana's hopes for a nurturing relationship.

**C. gradually modified through honest conversation**
This option suggests a collaborative, communicative process that contradicts both the meaning of "disabused" and the context provided. A student might choose this if they focus on the idea that Diana learned something new but miss how the author's word choice emphasizes suddenness and severity rather than gradual understanding. The passage shows Dr. Blackwell's correction came through actions and reprimands, not conversation, making this interpretation inconsistent with both the figurative language and the narrative details.

**D. temporarily challenged but ultimately fulfilled**
This option completely misreads both the word's meaning and the context, suggesting Diana eventually found the motherly figure she sought. A student selecting this likely misunderstands "disabused" entirely, perhaps confusing it with words that suggest temporary setbacks. The passage makes clear that Dr. Blackwell remained stern and professional throughout, never becoming the nurturing figure Diana initially hoped for, making this interpretation factually incorrect.

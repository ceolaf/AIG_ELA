### Rationales

**Option A:**  
- “Scolding” has a negative connotation, suggesting sharp or harsh criticism, often directed at a child.  
- This clashes with an admiring tone; while the narrator does admire Dr. Blackwell overall, this specific word choice focuses on how unpleasant the criticism feels, not on admiration.  
- Misreads the emotional impact of the word in context.

**Option B:**  
- A lighthearted tone would require playful or gentle language, but “scolding” suggests seriousness and discomfort.  
- The narrator already feels that she “could do nothing right” and fears being sent away, which is not light or humorous.  
- Ignores the stress and insecurity built up in this section.

**Option C (Correct):**  
- “Scolding” carries a connotation of being sharply corrected, almost like a child being lectured, which adds emotional weight beyond the neutral idea of “correction” or “feedback.”  
- This choice of word makes the tone tense and anxious, highlighting how harsh and frequent the criticism feels to the narrator.  
- Fits with nearby phrases like “I felt that I could do nothing right” and “Every day has brought at least one similar scolding.”

**Option D:**  
- While the setting is professional, “scolding” does not mainly contribute to formality; it emphasizes emotional discomfort and inequality in power.  
- A formal tone would more likely be created by neutral or technical terms, not by a word that suggests being talked down to.  
- Misidentifies the primary impact of the word choice on tone.

### Rationales

**Option B (Correct):**  
- The phrase “the farther it recedes in the distance” is figurative language. Approval is not a physical object that can literally move away.  
- By comparing approval to something that keeps moving farther away as she moves toward it, the narrator shows that the more effort she makes, the less attainable that approval seems.  
- This contributes to a tone of frustration and discouragement, because Diana feels her goal is slipping away despite her hard work.

**Option A (Distractor):**  
- Misinterprets the figurative phrase as describing physical movement and “distance” in a literal sense.  
- There is no evidence in the passage that Dr. Blackwell is traveling or moving away from Diana; the sentence is about emotional distance and approval, not geography.  
- The tone in this part of the passage is anxious and self-doubting, not adventurous.

**Option C (Distractor):**  
- Suggests that Dr. Blackwell is forgetting Diana and that this makes Diana feel relieved and free.  
- This conflicts with the passage: Diana wants Dr. Blackwell’s attention and respect; she fears being “sent away,” not being forgotten.  
- The figurative “recedes in the distance” describes Diana’s sense that approval is harder to reach, not that Dr. Blackwell is forgetting her.

**Option D (Distractor):**  
- Takes the language literally, as if Diana’s physical eyesight is failing and affecting what she can see.  
- The passage does not mention any eye problems; instead, it focuses on Diana’s emotional struggle and desire for professional approval.  
- The tone is not fearful about health but worried about competence and respect.

**Item**

Read this sentence from paragraph 9.

> Once again, I felt unjustly reprimanded, like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar.

What is the primary effect of the simile in this sentence?

A. It shows that the narrator recognizes she has done something wrong and feels guilty.
B. It reveals that the narrator views Dr. Blackwell as a caring but strict parental figure.
C. It suggests that the narrator is becoming openly defiant toward Dr. Blackwell’s authority.
D. It emphasizes that the narrator feels the scolding is for a minor mistake and makes her feel small.*

**Rationales**

*   **A. Rationale:** This option is incorrect. The narrator explicitly states that she feels "unjustly reprimanded," which indicates she does not believe her actions were wrong or warranted such a harsh scolding. The simile highlights her feeling of embarrassment, not guilt.
*   **B. Rationale:** This option is incorrect. Although the simile involves a child, the narrator has already stated in paragraph 4 that she was "quickly disabused" of the notion that Dr. Blackwell was a "motherly figure." The comparison serves to illustrate the power imbalance and her feelings of being belittled, not to define their relationship as parental.
*   **C. Rationale:** This option is incorrect. The simile conveys a feeling of being caught and shamed, not of defiance. A child caught sneaking sweets is typically embarrassed or chagrined, not actively rebellious. The narrator’s internal reaction is frustration, but her outward response is to "bite my tongue and say nothing."
*   **D. Rationale:** This is the correct option. The act of a child "sneaking sweets from a jar" is a minor, almost trivial, offense. By comparing Dr. Blackwell’s scolding to this scenario, the narrator emphasizes her perspective that her action (soothing a patient) was harmless and the reprimand was disproportionately harsh. The comparison to a "child" effectively conveys her feeling of being belittled and made to feel powerless in that moment.

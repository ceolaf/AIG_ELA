### Rationales

**A. I was gently encouraged to keep believing that idea.**  
- “Disabused” means to correct a false belief, not to support it.  
- The context shows Dr. Blackwell is strict and publicly reprimands the narrator, which would not encourage the “motherly” idea.  
- This is the opposite of the sentence’s meaning.

**B. I was forced to admit that my idea was wrong.*  
- “Disabused of that notion” is an idiomatic phrase meaning someone’s mistaken belief has been taken away.  
- The narrator expected a “motherly figure,” but Dr. Blackwell’s sharp public scoldings prove that belief false.  
- This option best matches both the literal meaning of “disabused” and the context of the narrator’s disappointment.

**C. I was persuaded to change my idea to a different one.**  
- This suggests a neutral change, but “disabused” carries the connotation of being corrected or set straight about a mistaken belief.  
- Nothing in the sentence suggests a gentle “persuasion” or a simple swap of ideas; it emphasizes that the hope was wrong.

**D. I was reminded that my idea was not very important.**  
- The phrase does not refer to importance; it refers to accuracy.  
- The narrator’s hope is clearly important to her; what changes is whether it is realistic.  
- This misreads the emotional and figurative impact of the phrase.

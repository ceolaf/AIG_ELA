**Rationales**

*   **A. (Correct):** The student must recognize that "extinguish" is used figuratively. They must understand its denotative meaning (to put out a fire, to bring to an end) and then analyze its connotative power in this context. The word implies a total, irreversible end, much like a snuffed-out flame cannot be easily relit. This choice highlights the high stakes for the narrator—failure means the absolute end of her dream, not just a delay or a disappointment, because this is the "only institution of its kind."

*   **B. (Incorrect):** This option misinterprets the narrator's perspective and the overall theme of the passage. The narrator's hopes are presented as valid and noble, and she is determined to achieve them. The word "extinguish" describes the external threat *to* her hopes if she is sent away, not an internal judgment *on* their validity. A student might choose this if they misread the source of the conflict, thinking the problem is with Diana's ambition rather than her difficult circumstances.

*   **C. (Incorrect):** This option incorrectly assigns malicious intent to Dr. Blackwell. The passage portrays Dr. Blackwell as strict, demanding, and focused on high standards, not as someone who is actively cruel. The "extinguishing" of hope would be a *consequence* of Diana failing to meet the standards, not the result of Dr. Blackwell's personal desire to hurt her. This requires the student to distinguish between the severity of a consequence and the intent of the person who might cause it.

*   **D. (Incorrect):** This option describes the opposite of what the word "extinguish" implies. The word suggests permanence and finality, not something that is easy to change, reverse, or shift. A student might choose this if they focus generally on the emotional nature of the narrator without connecting to the specific, powerful meaning of the chosen word, which implies an unchangeable outcome.

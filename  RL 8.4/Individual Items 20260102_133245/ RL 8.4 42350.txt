### Rationales

**A. (Key):** The student correctly interprets the simile. The act of "sneaking sweets" is a minor, childish misdeed, not a serious offense. By comparing her situation to this, the narrator, Diana, implies that her action of speaking soothingly to a patient was equally minor and well-intentioned. The feeling of being "caught" and reprimanded for such an act suggests a punishment that is out of proportion to the offense. This aligns perfectly with the text where Diana explicitly feels "unjustly reprimanded," indicating she believes Dr. Blackwell’s sharp reaction was too severe.

**B. (Distractor):** The student misinterprets the purpose of the figurative language. The narrator uses the comparison to a "child" to describe how she *feels* she is being treated by Dr. Blackwell in that moment—as if she is small, foolish, and deserving of a scolding. She is not using the comparison to make a statement about her own actual maturity or fitness for her job. The rest of the passage, particularly her competent performance during the busy evening, contradicts the idea that she is truly immature.

**C. (Distractor):** The student focuses on one part of the simile ("caught") while ignoring a key word in the sentence ("unjustly"). The narrator explicitly states that she feels the reprimand is unfair. A person who feels guilty would not typically describe their punishment as unjust. Therefore, the simile is meant to convey a sense of indignation at being unfairly treated, not an admission of guilt.

**D. (Distractor):** The student identifies an emotion that is plausible in the situation but is not the primary meaning of the simile itself. While Diana is likely embarrassed (the next sentence says the patient's sympathetic look "only made me feel worse"), the specific comparison to "a child caught sneaking sweets" is chosen to highlight the perceived injustice of the situation—the mismatch between a small, harmless act and a sharp, corrective response—rather than the public nature of the scolding.

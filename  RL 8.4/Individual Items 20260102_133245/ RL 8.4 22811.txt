### Rationales

**Option C (Correct):**  
- The “it” refers to “her approval.”  
- “Recedes in the distance” is figurative language that suggests something moving farther away and becoming harder to reach.  
- In context, the narrator explains that she keeps getting scolded and feels she “can do nothing right,” so Dr. Blackwell’s approval seems less attainable the more she tries to earn it.

**Option A (Distractor):**  
- Says her chances are “improving,” which is the opposite of something “reced[ing] in the distance.”  
- Ignores the negative context of repeated scoldings and self-doubt.

**Option B (Distractor):**  
- Misreads the phrase as describing her feelings about approval rather than how attainable it is.  
- The passage shows she still strongly wants approval; she worries she will be sent away and that this would “extinguish my hopes,” so her desire is not fading.

**Option D (Distractor):**  
- Takes the phrase literally, as if Dr. Blackwell is physically moving away.  
- The sentence is about approval, not physical distance, so this misinterprets the figurative language.

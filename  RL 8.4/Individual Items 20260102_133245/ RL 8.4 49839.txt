**Item**

Read this sentence from the passage.

> Once again, I felt unjustly reprimanded, like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar.

What is the main effect of the phrase “like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar”?

A. It shows that the narrator believes her conversation with the patient was a harmless and pleasant act.
B. It reveals that Dr. Blackwell believes the narrator is immature and requires constant supervision.
*C. It emphasizes that the narrator feels embarrassed and that the scolding was for a minor offense.
D. It suggests that the narrator knows she was breaking a rule and is disappointed that she was caught.

**Rationales**

*   **A. Rationale:** This option incorrectly focuses on the "sweets" part of the simile, interpreting it as a pleasant indulgence. While the narrator was trying to be kind, the primary purpose of the simile is to describe the *feeling of being reprimanded*, not to characterize her preceding action. The emotional weight is on being “caught” and treated like a “child,” not on the enjoyment of the “sweets.”
*   **B. Rationale:** This option incorrectly shifts the perspective to Dr. Blackwell. The sentence begins with "I felt," indicating that the simile describes the narrator's internal experience and feelings, not what Dr. Blackwell is thinking. While Dr. Blackwell’s actions cause this feeling, the phrase itself explains the narrator's reaction.
*   **C. Rationale (Key):** This is the correct answer. The simile effectively conveys two key aspects of the narrator's feelings. Comparing herself to a "child" highlights her sense of embarrassment and feeling of being patronized. Comparing her action to "sneaking sweets" suggests that she views her offense as minor and the resulting scolding as disproportionate and unjust, which is supported by the word “unjustly” in the sentence.
*   **D. Rationale:** This option correctly identifies the feeling of being "caught" but misinterprets the narrator's perspective on her own actions. The narrator explicitly states she felt "unjustly reprimanded," which contradicts the idea that she knowingly broke a rule and was simply disappointed to be caught. The simile is used to show the scolding felt unfair, not that her guilt was discovered.

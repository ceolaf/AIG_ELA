**Item:**

In the passage, the narrator describes feeling "like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar" after being reprimanded by Dr. Blackwell. What does this comparison reveal about the narrator's emotional state?

A. She feels guilty about taking something that doesn't belong to her.

B. She feels embarrassed about being caught doing something she knew was wrong.

*C. She feels unfairly shamed and treated as immature despite her good intentions.

D. She feels hungry and distracted by thoughts of food during work.

**Rationales:**

**Option A:** This response focuses only on the literal elements of the comparison (taking something that doesn't belong) without recognizing how the simile functions in context. The narrator isn't actually taking anything; she was speaking kindly to a patient. A student selecting this option likely missed the figurative nature of the comparison and how it relates to the narrator's actual situation.

**Option C (Key):** This response correctly identifies the connotative meaning of the comparison. The simile reveals the narrator's feeling of being unjustly treated—she was doing something she believed was right (comforting a frightened patient) but was made to feel ashamed, much like a child who might be scolded even when their intentions were innocent. The comparison emphasizes her sense of being treated as immature and her frustration with the unfairness of the reprimand, which aligns with her earlier statement that she felt "unjustly reprimanded."

**Option B:** This response partially understands the comparison but misses the crucial element of injustice that the narrator feels. While the comparison does involve embarrassment, the narrator explicitly states she felt "unjustly reprimanded," indicating she doesn't believe she was doing something wrong. A student choosing this option recognizes some figurative meaning but doesn't fully grasp how the author uses this simile to convey the narrator's sense of unfair treatment.

**Option D:** This response completely misses the figurative nature of the comparison and focuses on an irrelevant literal interpretation. The "sweets" in the simile are not meant to suggest actual hunger or food, but rather represent the universal childhood experience of being caught and scolded. A student selecting this option likely struggles with recognizing figurative language and its purpose in conveying emotional states.

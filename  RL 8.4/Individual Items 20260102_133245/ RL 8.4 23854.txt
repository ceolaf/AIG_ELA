**Multiple Choice Item - RL.8.4**

When Diana describes feeling "like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar" after Dr. Blackwell's reprimand, what does this analogy reveal about the tone and Diana's perception of the situation?

A. It suggests that Diana believes she deserves the punishment because she was actually doing something wrong.

B. *It emphasizes Diana's sense of unfair treatment and creates a tone of indignation about being diminished.

C. It shows that Diana has a sweet tooth and often thinks about food when she's nervous.

D. It indicates that Diana wishes she could return to the carefree days of childhood.

**Rationales:**

**Option A Rationale:** This response misses the key word "unjustly" that immediately precedes the analogy. While the comparison does evoke guilt, Diana explicitly states she felt "unjustly reprimanded," which contradicts the idea that she believes she deserves punishment. A test taker might choose this if they focus only on the surface meaning of being "caught" doing something wrong without considering the broader context and Diana's explicit feelings about the fairness of the reprimand.

**Option B Rationale (KEY):** This response correctly identifies how the analogy impacts both tone and meaning. The comparison to a child being caught doing something minor and harmless (sneaking sweets) when Diana was actually performing compassionate patient care creates a tone of indignation and unfairness. The word choice emphasizes how Diana feels diminished and treated like a child rather than a professional, which adds to the emotional weight of her frustration. The analogy highlights the disconnect between her good intentions and how she's being perceived.

**Option C Rationale:** This response takes the analogy completely literally, missing its figurative purpose entirely. The reference to "sweets from a jar" is not meant to indicate Diana's actual thoughts about food, but rather serves as a comparison to illustrate her emotional state. A test taker might choose this if they fail to recognize analogies and focus on literal details rather than the comparative relationship being established.

**Option D Rationale:** This response misinterprets the analogy's purpose and emotional impact. While the comparison does reference childhood, it's not about nostalgia or wanting to return to childhood, but rather about feeling inappropriately treated like a child in a professional setting. The analogy creates frustration, not wistfulness. A test taker might select this if they recognize the childhood connection but miss the negative connotations and the feeling of being unfairly diminished that the analogy conveys.

Here is a multiple-choice item written to the specifications provided.

**Item**

Read this sentence from paragraph 9.

> Once again, I felt unjustly reprimanded, like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar.

What is the impact of the simile “like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar”?

A. It shows that the narrator is afraid of Dr. Blackwell’s anger and its potential consequences.
B. It suggests that the narrator often misbehaves and is used to being scolded for her actions.
*C. It emphasizes that the narrator feels the reprimand is embarrassing and overly harsh for her minor offense.
D. It implies that the narrator believes she should be treated with more care, as a parent would treat a child.

**Rationales**

*   **A. Rationale:** This option is incorrect. While the narrator does fear the consequence of being sent away (as stated in paragraph 5), this specific simile focuses on the *nature* of the scolding itself—its injustice and embarrassing quality—rather than the fear of future consequences. The comparison is to a small, childish transgression, not a major, fear-inducing event.
*   **B. Rationale:** This option misinterprets the figurative language. The simile is used to describe how the narrator *feels* in this specific moment, not to describe a habitual pattern of behavior. A student who selects this option may be taking the comparison too literally, assuming that because the narrator feels like a misbehaving child, she must actually be one.
*   **C. Rationale:** This is the correct answer. The simile compares the narrator's action (speaking soothingly to a patient) to a minor, childish misdeed ("sneaking sweets"). This comparison highlights the narrator's feeling that Dr. Blackwell's sharp reprimand is disproportionate to the "crime." It emphasizes her sense of being treated unfairly and publicly embarrassed for something she does not see as a serious error.
*   **D. Rationale:** This option incorrectly interprets the meaning of being treated "like a child." In the context of the simile, being treated like a child is a negative experience associated with being caught and shamed. The narrator is not asking for parental care; rather, she is describing how the scolding makes her feel small and belittled.

   B. It shows that Dr. Blackwell’s approval is becoming less important to the narrator over time.  
   *C. It conveys that Dr. Blackwell’s approval feels harder and harder for the narrator to reach, adding a tone of discouragement.*  
   D. It implies that Dr. Blackwell no longer notices the narrator’s efforts at all.

**Rationales**

**Option A:**  
- Misinterprets the phrase literally as physical movement.  
- “Recedes in the distance” is used figuratively here; Dr. Blackwell’s approval is not an object moving away in space.  
- This ignores the emotional context of the narrator’s frustration and self-doubt.

**Option B:**  
- Misreads the connotation of “recedes” as “matters less.”  
- In context, the narrator is *more* focused on Dr. Blackwell’s approval, not less.  
- The phrase emphasizes how unreachable that approval feels, not that it has lost importance.

**Option C (KEY):**  
- Correctly interprets “recedes in the distance” as figurative language suggesting something that seems to move farther away the more you try to reach it.  
- This fits the context: the narrator keeps trying to impress Dr. Blackwell but only earns more scoldings.  
- Captures the impact on tone: the wording adds a sense of discouragement and emotional distance, deepening the narrator’s feeling of failure.

**Option D:**  
- Overstates the situation and adds an idea not supported by the text.  
- Dr. Blackwell clearly *does* notice the narrator’s efforts (she frequently reprimands her and later praises her).  
- “Recedes in the distance” refers to how the narrator *feels* about achieving approval, not to Dr. Blackwell’s attention or awareness.

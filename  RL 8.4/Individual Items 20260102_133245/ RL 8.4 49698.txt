**Multiple Choice Item**

In the passage, when Diana describes her hopes as something that "would extinguish," the author's word choice suggests that Diana views her dreams as:

A. Something that burns brightly but could easily be put out
*B. A vital force that gives her life meaning and direction
C. A dangerous fire that might consume her completely  
D. Something that provides warmth but little actual light

**Rationales:**

**Option A:** This response focuses only on the literal meaning of "extinguish" as putting out a fire, without recognizing the deeper connotative meaning. While "extinguish" does relate to fire imagery, this interpretation misses how the word choice reveals the essential, life-giving nature of Diana's aspirations. A student choosing this option likely understands the basic metaphorical connection but hasn't analyzed the full impact of the word choice on meaning.

**Option B (Correct Answer):** This response demonstrates understanding of how "extinguish" carries connotative meaning beyond its literal definition. The word choice suggests that Diana's hopes are not merely wishes, but something essential to her very being—like a flame that represents life itself. When something vital is "extinguished," it dies completely. This word choice reveals the intensity of Diana's commitment and how central becoming a doctor is to her identity and purpose, creating a tone of desperation and deep personal stakes.

**Option C:** This response misinterprets the connotative meaning by suggesting Diana views her dreams negatively. The word "extinguish" in context doesn't imply that her hopes are dangerous or destructive—quite the opposite. A student selecting this option may understand that figurative language is being used but has misread the emotional tone and Diana's attitude toward her aspirations.

**Option D:** This response shows limited understanding of the figurative meaning. While it recognizes some metaphorical connection to fire/light, it suggests Diana's hopes are weak or insufficient ("little actual light"), which contradicts the passionate, determined tone established throughout the passage. The word "extinguish" in this context emphasizes the vital importance of her dreams, not their inadequacy.

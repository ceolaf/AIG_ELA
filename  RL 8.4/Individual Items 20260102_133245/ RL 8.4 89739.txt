Here's a multiple choice item aligned to RL.8.4:

**Item:**

In the passage, the narrator describes feeling "like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar" after being reprimanded by Dr. Blackwell. What is the impact of this figurative language on the meaning and tone of the passage?

A. It emphasizes the narrator's guilt and shame, revealing how the reprimand makes her feel diminished and wrongfully accused.

*B. It highlights the narrator's sense of being treated unfairly and feeling small, while also suggesting she views Dr. Blackwell as an authority figure who makes her feel childish and powerless.

C. It shows that the narrator actually was doing something wrong by talking to the patient, similar to how a child breaks rules by taking sweets.

D. It demonstrates that the narrator is immature and unprofessional in her behavior, justifying Dr. Blackwell's harsh treatment.

**Rationales:**

**A.** This response captures part of the meaning (guilt and shame, feeling wrongfully accused) but misses the key element of how the simile reveals the power dynamic and the narrator's sense of being diminished to a childlike state. It focuses too narrowly on the emotional response without recognizing the broader implications for characterization and tone.

**B. (Key)** This response fully captures how the simile works on multiple levels. The comparison to "a child caught sneaking sweets" reveals not only the narrator's feelings of unfair treatment and diminishment, but also establishes the power dynamic where Dr. Blackwell is positioned as the stern adult authority figure. The figurative language emphasizes how the professional relationship makes the narrator feel reduced to a powerless, childlike state, which adds to the tone of frustration and vulnerability throughout the passage.

**C.** This response misinterprets the figurative language by taking it too literally, suggesting the narrator actually was doing something as clearly wrong as stealing sweets. This misses how the simile is used to convey the narrator's sense of being unjustly reprimanded, as she was actually trying to comfort a frightened patient.

**D.** This response misreads the impact of the figurative language entirely, using it to justify Dr. Blackwell's behavior rather than recognizing how it reveals the narrator's perspective and emotional state. The simile is meant to show how the narrator feels treated, not to suggest she deserves such treatment.

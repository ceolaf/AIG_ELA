---
**Rationales:**

*   **A. (Key):** The student correctly interprets the metaphorical language. The phrase "recedes in the distance" creates an image of an object moving farther away, becoming harder to see or reach. By applying this to "approval," the student understands that Diana feels her goal of earning Dr. Blackwell's respect is becoming more, not less, difficult to achieve, despite her efforts.

*   **B. (Distractor):** The student is likely interpreting the word "distance" in a literal or personal sense rather than a figurative one. The text suggests Dr. Blackwell is watching Diana closely ("watchful eye"), not avoiding her. The "distance" refers to the unattainability of the goal (approval), not a physical or emotional distance between the two people.

*   **C. (Distractor):** The student misunderstands the connotative meaning of "recedes." This word suggests a loss of hope or a goal that is slipping away, which creates a feeling of frustration, not patience. If the phrase were "is in the distance," it might imply a long but achievable journey, but "recedes" implies movement away from the observer.

*   **D. (Distractor):** The student has made an inference that is directly contradicted by the text. The sentence begins with "the more I seek her approval," which shows that Diana cares deeply about what Dr. Blackwell thinks. The metaphor is used to express her frustration with this desire, not a diminishing of it.

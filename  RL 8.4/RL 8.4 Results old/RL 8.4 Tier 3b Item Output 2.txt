### Rationales

**Option B (Correct):**  
- In context, “the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance” uses “recedes” figuratively to compare approval to something physically moving farther away.  
- This word choice emphasizes the narrator’s frustration and discouragement: the harder she works for approval, the more unreachable it feels.  
- This captures both the literal meaning of “recedes” (moves back/away) and its connotation of something slipping out of reach, which shapes the tone as discouraged and anxious.

**Option A (Distractor):**  
- “Becoming less important to her” misinterprets the sentence. The narrator is seeking approval more, which shows it is very important to her.  
- This ignores the figurative comparison of approval to something that is physically moving away; it shifts the focus from “distance” to “importance,” which is not supported by the text.

**Option C (Distractor):**  
- “Hidden and must be searched for carefully” suggests a static object that is hard to find, not something that is moving away.  
- This misses the key connotation of “recedes,” which implies motion and increasing distance, not concealment.

**Option D (Distractor):**  
- “Will come to her if she simply waits patiently” is the opposite of the sentence’s meaning.  
- The word “recedes” suggests that approval is getting farther away over time, not that it is approaching her.  
- This choice ignores the discouraging tone created by the author’s word choice and instead suggests confidence and patience, which are not reflected in the passage.

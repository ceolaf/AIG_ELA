### Rationales

**A. It suggests that Dr. Blackwell is physically moving away from Diana, making it hard for Diana to speak with her.**  
- Misinterprets the figurative language as literal.  
- “Approval” cannot literally move away; the phrase is metaphorical, not about physical distance.

**B. It shows that Diana thinks earning Dr. Blackwell’s approval is becoming less and less possible, creating a discouraged tone.*  
- Correct.  
- “Recedes in the distance” figuratively compares approval to something that keeps moving farther away as she approaches.  
- This emphasizes how unreachable Dr. Blackwell’s approval feels to Diana and contributes to a tone of frustration and discouragement.

**C. It explains that Dr. Blackwell is too busy with patients to notice Diana’s efforts, creating a rushed tone.**  
- Adds an idea (Dr. Blackwell being too busy) that is not in the sentence.  
- The focus is on Diana’s *perception* of approval, not on Dr. Blackwell’s schedule or speed.

**D. It means that Diana has stopped caring about Dr. Blackwell’s opinion, creating a confident tone.**  
- Directly contradicts the text.  
- Diana says “the more I seek her approval,” which shows she still cares deeply; the phrase signals difficulty, not confidence.

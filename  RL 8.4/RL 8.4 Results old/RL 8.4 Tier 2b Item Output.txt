### Rationales

**Correct Answer: C. They were unfriendly and uncaring toward others.*  
- “Hard hearts” is a figurative phrase; hearts cannot literally be hard.  
- In context, the boy is crying, “My kitten, oh, my kitten! Her will fweeze!” and “the few people who hurried by did not notice him.”  
- He feels that “this village was to him a very strange and perplexing place,” suggesting he sees the people as cold or unkind.  
- Therefore, “had hard hearts” conveys the idea that the townspeople seem emotionally cold, unfriendly, and uncaring.

**A. They were physically strong and healthy.**  
- This misreads “hard” as describing physical toughness rather than emotions.  
- The sentence focuses on how the boy *feels* about the people (their emotional response to him and his kitten), not their bodies or health.  
- Nothing in the passage mentions strength or health here, so this is not supported by the text.

**B. They were wealthy and powerful in the town.**  
- “Fine clothes” might suggest wealth, which can mislead students into thinking “hard hearts” also refers to social status.  
- However, “hard hearts” describes their *emotional quality*, not their money or power.  
- The boy’s problem is that no one helps him, not that they are important or influential.

**D. They were brave and not easily frightened.**  
- This interprets “hard” as “tough” or “fearless,” which might be a common association, but it does not fit the situation.  
- The scene involves people ignoring a crying child and a freezing kitten; bravery is not mentioned or implied.  
- The phrase is used to show lack of compassion, not courage.


================= NEW ITEM =================
Tier 2b (GPT) #2 (temp=0.8)

**Item (RL.8.4 – figurative/connotative meaning and tone)**

Read this sentence from the passage:

> “His sister was a tall, strong girl, and she walked rapidly and resolutely, as if she knew exactly where she was going and what she was going to do next. She wore a man’s long ulster (not as if it were an affliction, but as if it were very comfortable and belonged to her; **carried it like a young soldier**), and a round plush cap, tied down with a thick veil.”

How does the comparison “carried it like a young soldier” most affect the tone of this description of Alexandra?

A. It makes her seem playful and careless, as if she does not take anything seriously.  
B. It makes her seem proud and determined, as if she is ready to face challenges.*  
C. It makes her seem frightened and unsure, as if she wants to hide from the town.  
D. It makes her seem weak and helpless, as if she cannot manage on her own.

### Rationales

**Correct Answer: B. It makes her seem proud and determined, as if she is ready to face challenges.*  
- The simile “like a young soldier” is figurative language comparing Alexandra to a soldier.  
- Soldiers are commonly associated with determination, readiness, and courage.  
- The passage also says she walked “rapidly and resolutely” and “as if she knew exactly where she was going and what she was going to do next,” reinforcing a tone of strength and purpose.  
- Therefore, the comparison creates a tone that presents Alexandra as proud, firm, and ready to meet difficulties.

**A. It makes her seem playful and careless, as if she does not take anything seriously.**  
- “Playful” and “careless” conflict with the words “resolutely” and “serious, thoughtful face” in the passage.  
- Soldiers are not typically symbols of carelessness; this choice ignores the connotations of “soldier” and the rest of the sentence.

**C. It makes her seem frightened and unsure, as if she wants to hide from the town.**  
- Nothing in the comparison to a soldier suggests fear or uncertainty.  
- The passage emphasizes that she walks as if she “knew exactly where she was going and what she was going to do next,” which is the opposite of being unsure.  
- This answer misreads the figurative language and the surrounding context.

**D. It makes her seem weak and helpless, as if she cannot manage on her own.**  
- Soldiers are associated with strength and capability, not weakness.  
- Alexandra is described as “tall, strong” and taking charge of the situation with Emil and the kitten.  
- This choice contradicts both the connotations of “soldier” and the narrative details.

Tier 6a (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7)

1. Read this sentence from the passage:

   “It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it **recedes in the distance**.”

   What is the best interpretation of the phrase “recedes in the distance” as it is used in this sentence?

   A. Her approval is becoming less important to the narrator over time.  
   B. Her approval seems harder and harder for the narrator to reach.*  
   C. Her approval is moving to a different location in the clinic.  
   D. Her approval is being given to the other nurses instead of to her.

**Correct Answer: B***

**Rationales**

- **A. Her approval is becoming less important to the narrator over time.**  
  This is incorrect because the sentence and the paragraph show the opposite: the narrator is increasingly focused on earning Dr. Blackwell’s approval. The figurative phrase “recedes in the distance” suggests it is harder to get, not that it matters less.

- **B. Her approval seems harder and harder for the narrator to reach.*  
  This is correct because “recedes in the distance” is used figuratively, like an object that keeps moving farther away as you walk toward it. The narrator says “the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes,” showing that, in her experience, Dr. Blackwell’s approval feels less attainable the more she tries to earn it. This captures the connotative meaning and the frustrated tone of the sentence.

- **C. Her approval is moving to a different location in the clinic.**  
  This is incorrect because it takes the phrase literally, as if approval could physically move. The passage uses “recedes in the distance” metaphorically to describe how approval feels emotionally and psychologically, not where it is located in space.

- **D. Her approval is being given to the other nurses instead of to her.**  
  This is incorrect because the sentence does not mention other nurses receiving approval. The focus is on the narrator’s own struggle and feelings of failure, not on comparison with others. “Recedes in the distance” emphasizes inaccessibility, not redistribution to someone else.

1. In the sentence, “the little town of Hanover, **anchored** on a windy Nebraska tableland, was trying not to be blown away,” what is the effect of the word *anchored* on the meaning and tone of the description?

A. It suggests the town is safely held in place, creating a calm and secure tone.  
B. It compares the town to a ship tied down in a storm, emphasizing how fragile and temporary it feels.*  
C. It shows that the town is heavy and cannot possibly move, making the scene feel dull and lifeless.  
D. It hints that the town is rich and powerful, giving the scene an impressive and proud tone.

**Rationales**

- **A. It suggests the town is safely held in place, creating a calm and secure tone.**  
  This misreads the figurative use. While “anchored” can literally suggest safety, the rest of the sentence (“trying not to be blown away”) shows the town is *not* secure. Choosing this overlooks how the word choice works with the surrounding description to create tension, not calm.

- **B. It compares the town to a ship tied down in a storm, emphasizing how fragile and temporary it feels.*  
  This is correct. “Anchored” is a nautical metaphor that alludes to a ship in rough weather. In context, the town is “anchored” yet “trying not to be blown away,” so the word highlights how the town is barely holding on against the wind and seems impermanent. This figurative use shapes a tense, precarious tone rather than simple stability.

- **C. It shows that the town is heavy and cannot possibly move, making the scene feel dull and lifeless.**  
  This takes only the literal idea of weight and ignores the storm-like context. The town is described as if it *could* be “blown away,” so the tone is not dull or lifeless but uneasy and exposed. This choice misses the figurative comparison and the contrast Cather creates.

- **D. It hints that the town is rich and powerful, giving the scene an impressive and proud tone.**  
  Nothing in “anchored” or the surrounding description suggests wealth or power; instead, the town has “low drab buildings” and “no appearance of permanence.” This answer misinterprets the connotation and ignores the negative, vulnerable tone developed by the passage.

Tier 6b (GPT) #2 (temp=0.8)

2. In the description, “the little town of Hanover, anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland, was **trying not to be blown away**,” what is the effect of the phrase “trying not to be blown away” on the meaning and tone of the passage?

A. It literally explains that the buildings are about to collapse because of the wind.  
B. It humorously exaggerates the town’s struggle against the wind, making the town seem small and vulnerable.*  
C. It shows that the people in the town are lazy and do not want to go outside.  
D. It describes how quickly the town is growing and spreading across the prairie.

**Rationales**

- **A. It literally explains that the buildings are about to collapse because of the wind.**  
  This takes the phrase too literally. The town itself cannot “try,” and the passage does not describe actual collapse. The wording is figurative, personifying the town to show its struggle, not to report a real structural emergency.

- **B. It humorously exaggerates the town’s struggle against the wind, making the town seem small and vulnerable.*  
  This is correct. The phrase personifies the town as if it were actively “trying” to resist being blown away, an exaggeration that highlights how exposed and fragile it is on the open prairie. This figurative language shapes a tone that is slightly playful but also emphasizes the town’s weakness.

- **C. It shows that the people in the town are lazy and do not want to go outside.**  
  The sentence focuses on the *town* as a whole, not the people’s work habits. Nothing in the phrase “trying not to be blown away” suggests laziness; it instead suggests effort and struggle, so this misreads the connotation.

- **D. It describes how quickly the town is growing and spreading across the prairie.**  
  The larger description stresses that the town has “no appearance of permanence” and might be “blown away,” the opposite of stable growth. This option ignores the negative, precarious tone created by the figurative phrase.

1. Read this sentence from the passage:

   “It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance.”

   What is the best interpretation of the phrase “the farther it recedes in the distance” as it is used in this sentence?

   A. Her approval is something the narrator no longer wants.  
   *B. Her approval feels harder and harder for the narrator to reach.*  
   C. Her approval is moving to another place far away.  
   D. Her approval is something the narrator can clearly see ahead of her.

**Correct Answer: B***

**Rationales:**

- **Option A:**  
  - Misinterprets the figurative language.  
  - “Recedes in the distance” suggests the approval is becoming less attainable, not that the narrator no longer wants it.  
  - The text shows she desperately wants Dr. Blackwell’s respect (“I must somehow manage to do better… and gain the doctor’s respect”).

- **Option B (Correct):**  
  - Interprets the phrase figuratively and in context.  
  - “Recedes in the distance” is a metaphor comparing approval to something that moves farther away as you move toward it.  
  - This fits the narrator’s experience: the more she tries to impress Dr. Blackwell, the more she feels she is failing (“Every day has brought at least one similar scolding”).  
  - Captures both the meaning of the phrase and the discouraged tone.

- **Option C:**  
  - Takes the phrase too literally, as if the approval is physically moving to a new place.  
  - Approval is an abstract idea; it cannot literally move locations.  
  - This ignores the metaphorical use of distance to show emotional difficulty, not physical movement.

- **Option D:**  
  - Contradicts the image created by “recedes in the distance.”  
  - Something that “recedes” becomes *less* clear and more out of reach, not “clearly seen ahead.”  
  - The narrator feels uncertain and discouraged, not confident and sure of gaining approval.

1. Read this sentence from the passage:

> “It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it **recedes** in the distance.”

As it is used in this sentence, what is the most accurate meaning of the word “recedes”?

A. It moves away from her, becoming harder to reach.*  
B. It is taken back, as if someone changed their mind.  
C. It disappears completely and no longer exists.  
D. It becomes less important to her over time.

**Rationales**

- **A. It moves away from her, becoming harder to reach.*  
  - “Recedes in the distance” is a figurative image of something physically moving farther away. The narrator is saying that Dr. Blackwell’s approval seems to get harder and harder to obtain the more she tries. This choice captures both the literal sense of “recedes” (moves back) and the connotative idea that the approval feels out of reach, which matches the tone of frustration and self-doubt.

- **B. It is taken back, as if someone changed their mind.**  
  - This describes a situation where approval is given and then withdrawn, like “receding” an offer. In the passage, however, the narrator never has Dr. Blackwell’s approval in the first place; she is trying to gain it. So this does not fit how the word is used in context.

- **C. It disappears completely and no longer exists.**  
  - The sentence suggests the approval is distant, not gone. The metaphor of something “farther in the distance” implies it is still there but unreachable, not completely vanished. This overstates the meaning and changes the tone from frustration to hopelessness, which the passage does not support.

- **D. It becomes less important to her over time.**  
  - The narrator’s desire for approval does not become less important; if anything, it grows more intense. The word “recedes” here does not describe a change in importance but a change in how attainable the approval feels. This misreads the figurative image and conflicts with the narrator’s ongoing anxiety.

**Answer Key:**  
B*

**Rationales:**

**Option B (Correct):**  
- “Perplexing” means confusing or difficult to understand.  
- In context, the boy is crying, afraid to ask for help, and feels that people in the village “had hard hearts.”  
- The word “perplexing” emphasizes that the village is not just unfamiliar, but emotionally and socially confusing and overwhelming to him, reinforcing his sense of isolation and discomfort.  
- This aligns with RL.8.4 because it focuses on how a specific word choice shapes the reader’s understanding of his feelings.

**Option A (Distractor):**  
- “Angry” and “refuses to accept it” suggest a strong, active rejection.  
- The text shows the boy is shy, afraid, and “sunk in despair,” not angry or defiant.  
- “Perplexing” does not carry a connotation of anger; it emphasizes confusion, not refusal.

**Option C (Distractor):**  
- “Exciting and full of possibilities” is a positive connotation.  
- Nothing in the description of the village (“hard hearts,” strange, crying alone, afraid to speak) suggests excitement or opportunity.  
- This misreads the tone created by “perplexing,” which is uneasy and bewildered, not hopeful.

**Option D (Distractor):**  
- While the boy is uncomfortable, the word “perplexing” does not literally mean dangerous or threatening.  
- The passage does not mention physical danger; instead, it stresses emotional discomfort and social confusion.  
- This option exaggerates the connotation beyond what the word choice supports.

Tier 3a (GPT) #2 (temp=0.8)

2. Read the sentence from the passage.

   “His sister was a tall, strong girl, and she walked rapidly and **resolutely**, as if she knew exactly where she was going and what she was going to do next.”

   What is the most accurate effect of the author’s use of the word **“resolutely”** in this sentence?

   A. It shows that she is stubborn and refuses to listen to anyone else’s ideas.  
   B. It suggests that she is brave but also reckless about the risks she faces.  
   C. It shows that she moves with firm determination and a clear purpose.*  
   D. It suggests that she is impatient and annoyed with the people around her.

---

**Answer Key:**  
C*

---

**Rationales:**

**Option C (Correct):**  
- “Resolutely” means with firm purpose or determination.  
- The sentence reinforces this meaning by adding “as if she knew exactly where she was going and what she was going to do next.”  
- This word choice shapes the tone around Alexandra as confident and purposeful, helping readers see her as a strong, capable character.

**Option A (Distractor):**  
- “Stubborn” implies an unwillingness to change one’s mind or listen, which is not shown here.  
- The text focuses on how she walks, not how she reacts to others’ ideas.  
- This misinterprets the connotation of “resolutely,” which emphasizes determination, not unreasonable stubbornness.

**Option B (Distractor):**  
- “Reckless” suggests carelessness about danger.  
- Nothing in the sentence indicates that she is ignoring risks or acting carelessly; instead, it stresses that she “knew exactly” what she was doing.  
- This adds a negative connotation that “resolutely” does not carry in this context.

**Option D (Distractor):**  
- “Impatient and annoyed” would suggest irritation with others, which isn’t described here.  
- The sentence focuses on her inner purpose, not her feelings toward other people.  
- This misreads the tone created by “resolutely,” which is steady and focused, not irritated.

   “If I was hoping to find a motherly figure in Dr. Blackwell, I was quickly **disabused of that notion**.”

   A. stopped believing that Dr. Blackwell would be gentle and nurturing with her*  
   B. became angry that Dr. Blackwell treated her like a child  
   C. realized that Dr. Blackwell did not remember who she was  
   D. decided that she no longer wanted to become a doctor

### Correct Answer
**A. stopped believing that Dr. Blackwell would be gentle and nurturing with her***

### Rationales

**A. stopped believing that Dr. Blackwell would be gentle and nurturing with her***  
- “Disabused of that notion” is a figurative phrase meaning that someone has been corrected or set straight from a mistaken belief.  
- The “notion” is clearly stated: “If I was hoping to find a motherly figure in Dr. Blackwell…”  
- The context that follows—Dr. Blackwell reprimanding her publicly and often—shows that the narrator learns Dr. Blackwell is strict, not “motherly.”  
- Thus, the narrator’s belief that Dr. Blackwell would be a gentle, comforting “motherly figure” is taken away; she stops believing that idea.

**B. became angry that Dr. Blackwell treated her like a child**  
- This option focuses on the narrator’s emotions (anger) rather than on the meaning of the phrase.  
- While the narrator “felt unjustly reprimanded, like a child,” the phrase “disabused of that notion” describes the correction of a belief, not her anger.  
- “Disabused” is about losing a mistaken idea, not about becoming upset.

**C. realized that Dr. Blackwell did not remember who she was**  
- Nothing in the text suggests Dr. Blackwell forgets the narrator.  
- The “notion” being corrected is about Dr. Blackwell being a “motherly figure,” not about her memory.  
- This misreads the figurative phrase and ignores the clear context.

**D. decided that she no longer wanted to become a doctor**  
- The narrator continues to hope to become a doctor: she fears being sent away would “extinguish my hopes,” showing she still wants this goal.  
- The phrase “disabused of that notion” refers specifically to her expectations about Dr. Blackwell’s personality, not her career ambitions.  
- This choice confuses the corrected belief (about Dr. Blackwell’s role) with the narrator’s long-term dream.

this standard is not the L4 standard about figuring out the meaning of unknown words based on context clues and the like. It is not about determining test takers vocabulary expertise. Therefore, it is not about recognizing or determining the denotative or literal meaning of a word, regardless of the word’s level or difficulty. This skill cannot be assessed with a focal word that the reader does not already know, because they would then simply be relying on context and etymology clues to determine meaning, with the required burden of having to look beyond knowledge (i.e., of the denotative meaning) that they already had. Obviously, this cannot be assessed with a focus word that is used a straight forward literal application of the denotative meaning of the word. This standard is not about recognizing cliché symbolism or the meanings of words that describe it.

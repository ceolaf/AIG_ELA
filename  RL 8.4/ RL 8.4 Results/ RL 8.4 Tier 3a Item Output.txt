1. Read this sentence from the passage.

   “It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it **recedes** in the distance.”

   Based on how the word is used in this sentence, what is the most accurate meaning of **recedes**?

   A. To become less important over time  
   *B. To move farther away or out of reach*  
   C. To disappear suddenly and completely  
   D. To be taken away by someone else  

**Correct Answer: B***

**Rationales:**

- **A. To become less important over time**  
  This suggests that Dr. Blackwell’s approval matters less to Diana as time passes. In the passage, the opposite is true: Diana cares more and more about earning that approval. The sentence also uses a distance image (“in the distance”), which focuses on physical/figurative space, not importance.

- **B. To move farther away or out of reach***  
  This fits both the literal and figurative language in the sentence. “Recedes in the distance” uses a visual image of something moving farther away, like a ship receding on the horizon, to show that the more Diana tries to gain Dr. Blackwell’s approval, the harder it feels to attain. This captures the connotative meaning and the tone of frustration and discouragement.

- **C. To disappear suddenly and completely**  
  “Recedes” suggests a gradual movement away, not a sudden vanishing. The phrase “the farther it recedes in the distance” implies it is still there, just becoming more distant, so this does not match the nuance of the word choice.

- **D. To be taken away by someone else**  
  Nothing in the sentence suggests that another person is actively removing Dr. Blackwell’s approval. The word “recedes” focuses on the approval itself seeming to move away, not on someone taking it. This misinterprets the figurative image the author uses.

2. Read this sentence from the passage.

   “If I was hoping to find a **motherly figure** in Dr. Blackwell, I was quickly **disabused** of that notion.”

   How does the author’s use of the word **disabused** affect the tone of this sentence?

   A. It makes the tone light and humorous, as if the narrator is only mildly surprised.  
   B. It makes the tone admiring, suggesting the narrator is pleased to be corrected.  
   *C. It makes the tone sharp and slightly bitter, showing the narrator’s disappointment.*  
   D. It makes the tone fearful, suggesting the narrator is afraid of Dr. Blackwell.  

**Correct Answer: C***

**Rationales:**

- **A. It makes the tone light and humorous, as if the narrator is only mildly surprised.**  
  “Disabused” is a serious, formal word that implies a firm correction of a mistaken belief. Combined with “quickly disabused,” it does not sound playful or humorous. The context—public reprimands and constant scoldings—also does not support a light tone.

- **B. It makes the tone admiring, suggesting the narrator is pleased to be corrected.**  
  While the narrator respects Dr. Blackwell, the sentence focuses on lost expectations. The narrator hoped for a “motherly figure” and did not get one. “Disabused” emphasizes the harshness of having that hope corrected, not pleasure or admiration.

- **C. It makes the tone sharp and slightly bitter, showing the narrator’s disappointment.*  
  “Disabused” means to be freed from a false idea, often in a blunt or uncomfortable way. The phrase “quickly disabused of that notion” suggests the narrator’s hopeful idea was knocked down abruptly. This word choice adds a sharp, somewhat bitter tone that highlights the narrator’s disappointment in discovering that Dr. Blackwell is not warm or motherly.

- **D. It makes the tone fearful, suggesting the narrator is afraid of Dr. Blackwell.**  
  The sentence shows disappointment and a correction of expectations, not fear. The narrator feels “unjustly reprimanded” and frustrated, but nothing in the word “disabused” itself suggests that she is afraid; it focuses on being corrected, not on being scared.

Here is a unique multiple-choice item written for 8th-grade students, aligned to Common Core State Standard RL.8.4, based on the passage "Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant."

**Item ID:** RL.8.4-Blackwell-01
**Standard:** CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.8.4
**Depth of Knowledge:** 2 (Skill/Concept)

**Question:**

Read the sentence from paragraph 5.

“That would **extinguish** my hopes, for the Women’s Medical College that Dr. Blackwell has founded here at the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children is the only institution of its kind.”

What is the impact of the author's use of the word **extinguish** on the meaning of the sentence?

A. It implies that the narrator believes her ambition is dangerous and needs to be controlled like a fire.
B. It suggests that the narrator is feeling burnt out and exhausted from the difficult work at the clinic.
C. It highlights the devastating and permanent nature of losing the chance to become a doctor.*
D. It indicates that the narrator’s progress in medical school will be temporarily delayed.

***

**Rationales:**

*   **Option A is incorrect.** While the word "extinguish" is often used in the context of putting out a dangerous fire, the context of the passage shows that the narrator cherishes her hope of becoming a doctor. She does not view her ambition as something negative that needs to be "controlled" or stopped for safety.
*   **Option B is incorrect.** This option relies on a misinterpretation of idioms related to fire (such as "burning out"). While the narrator is working hard, the word "extinguish" in this context refers to the external removal of her opportunity by Dr. Blackwell, not an internal feeling of tiredness or exhaustion.
*   **Option C is correct.** The author uses the word "extinguish" metaphorically to compare the narrator's hope to a flame or light. Because the text states that this is the "only institution of its kind," being sent away would not just pause her career, but end it completely. "Extinguish" carries a connotation of finality and totality, emphasizing how high the stakes are for the narrator.
*   **Option D is incorrect.** This option underestimates the strength of the word "extinguish." To extinguish a fire is to put it out completely, not just to dim it or pause it. The context supports this finality because there are no other schools the narrator can attend; therefore, the delay would not be temporary.

Here is a unique multiple-choice item aligned to Common Core State Standard RL.8.4, based on the passage "Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant."

**Item ID:** RL.8.4-Blackwell-02
**Standard:** CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.8.4
**Depth of Knowledge:** 2 (Skill/Concept)

**Question:**

Read the sentence from paragraph 7.

“Female physicians are still more of a **curiosity** than anything.”

How does the author’s use of the word **curiosity** impact the meaning of the sentence?

A. It suggests that the public is eager to ask questions and learn from the new doctors.
B. It implies that female doctors are viewed as strange oddities rather than respected professionals.*
C. It conveys that the doctors are still experimenting with new medical treatments to see what works.
D. It indicates that the patients are suspicious of the doctors because they lack proper training.

***

**Rationales:**

*   **Option A is incorrect.** This option relies on the most common definition of "curiosity" as a desire to know or learn something. However, in this context, the word is used as a noun to describe the doctors themselves ("*a* curiosity"), not the feeling of the public. The text indicates that people are unsure of them, not necessarily eager to learn from them.
*   **Option B is correct.** In this context, the word "curiosity" refers to an unusual or interesting object or fact (like an item in a museum or a sideshow). By labeling female physicians as a "curiosity," the narrator emphasizes that society sees them as a spectacle or a novelty, rather than as serious, legitimate medical practitioners. This highlights the struggle for respect described in the passage.
*   **Option C is incorrect.** This option misinterprets "curiosity" as relating to scientific inquiry or experimentation. The sentence is describing how the *public* sees the doctors, not how the doctors practice medicine.
*   **Option D is incorrect.** While the paragraph mentions that patients might "doubt" the doctors, the word "curiosity" does not specifically mean suspicion or lack of training. It refers to the *uncommon* nature of women in the role. A person can be a "curiosity" (something rare) without necessarily being suspected of incompetence, though the two concepts overlap in the passage's broader theme.

Here is a multiple choice item aligned to RL.8.4:

**Read this sentence from paragraph 4:**

"If I was hoping to find a motherly figure in Dr. Blackwell, I was quickly disabused of that notion."

What does the phrase "disabused of that notion" suggest about Diana's experience with Dr. Blackwell?

A. Diana was confused by Dr. Blackwell's teaching methods and needed clarification.

B. Diana was harshly corrected and forced to abandon her expectation.

C. Diana was gently guided to understand Dr. Blackwell's personality.

D. Diana was disappointed but gradually accepted the situation.

**Answer Key:** B*

**Rationales:**

**Option A:** A student might select this if they focus on the idea of confusion or misunderstanding implied by "notion," but miss the forceful connotation of "disabused." This interpretation doesn't capture the harsh, abrupt nature of the correction implied by the word choice.

**Option B (Correct):** This is correct because "disabused" carries a connotation of being forcefully freed from a false belief or misconception. Combined with "quickly" and the context of Dr. Blackwell's harsh reprimand that immediately follows, the phrase suggests Diana's expectation was abruptly and harshly corrected through her actual experience.

**Option C:** Students might choose this if they misunderstand "disabused" as a gentle correction or teaching moment. However, the word carries a much stronger, more forceful connotation than gentle guidance, and the context shows Dr. Blackwell's approach was anything but gentle.

**Option D:** This distractor might appeal to students who understand there was disappointment but miss the forceful, immediate nature of "quickly disabused." This option suggests a gradual process, while the text indicates an immediate and harsh realization.

The item tests understanding of the connotative meaning of "disabused" - a word that suggests forceful correction rather than gentle enlightenment - and how this word choice impacts the tone, revealing the harsh reality Diana faced versus her hopeful expectations.

Here is another multiple choice item aligned to RL.8.4:

**Read this sentence from paragraph 4:**

"It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance."

How does the author's use of the word "recedes" impact the meaning and tone of Diana's struggle?

A. It suggests that Dr. Blackwell's approval moves away like an unreachable horizon, emphasizing Diana's growing desperation.

B. It indicates that Dr. Blackwell is deliberately withdrawing her support, showing her cruelty toward Diana.

C. It implies that Diana is losing interest in gaining approval, revealing her decreasing motivation.

D. It shows that the approval is fading from memory, suggesting Diana has given up hope.

**Answer Key:** A*

**Rationales:**

**Option A (Correct):** This is correct because "recedes" creates an image of something moving backward or retreating as one approaches it, like waves pulling back from the shore or a distant horizon that never gets closer. This word choice emphasizes the futility and frustration of Diana's efforts—the harder she tries, the more impossible her goal becomes. The tone becomes one of desperation and helplessness.

**Option B:** Students might select this if they interpret "recedes" as an intentional action by Dr. Blackwell. However, the metaphorical use of "recedes in the distance" suggests a phenomenon rather than a deliberate withdrawal. The focus is on Diana's perception of an unreachable goal, not on Dr. Blackwell's intentions.

**Option C:** This distractor misinterprets who is doing the receding. Students might confuse the subject and think Diana herself is pulling away from the goal. However, the sentence structure clearly shows it's the approval that recedes, not Diana's desire for it.

**Option D:** Students might choose this if they associate "recedes" with fading or disappearing. However, "recedes in the distance" suggests something moving away spatially rather than fading from memory. The context also shows Diana is still actively seeking approval, not giving up.

The item tests understanding of how the figurative use of "recedes" creates a specific image of futile pursuit, impacting both the meaning (approval becomes increasingly unattainable despite effort) and the tone (frustration and desperation).

Passage: RL 8.4 Oh Pioneers (TN grade 8 Released 2023).txt
Tier 3a (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7). (6.80 secs). (1464 + 378 = 1842 total tokens)

1. In the sentence, “Her master was sunk in despair,” what is the most accurate meaning of the word “sunk” as it is used in this context?

A. Suddenly dropped down onto the sidewalk  
B. Became completely overwhelmed by sadness*  
C. Was lowered into the ground  
D. Fell asleep without noticing

**Correct Answer: B. Became completely overwhelmed by sadness***

**Rationales:**

- **A. Suddenly dropped down onto the sidewalk**  
  This choice takes “sunk” literally, as if the boy physically dropped down. However, the sentence focuses on his emotional state (“in despair”), not his physical position. The phrase “sunk in despair” is figurative, describing how deeply sad he feels.

- **B. Became completely overwhelmed by sadness***  
  This is correct because “sunk in despair” is a figurative expression meaning he is deeply, almost helplessly, absorbed in his sadness. The context—his crying, fear for his kitten, and feeling that the town is “strange and perplexing” with people who have “hard hearts”—supports this emotional meaning.

- **C. Was lowered into the ground**  
  This is another literal interpretation of “sunk,” like something being buried or going below the surface. Nothing in the passage suggests the boy is physically going into the ground; the phrase clearly modifies his emotional state (“despair”), not a physical action.

- **D. Fell asleep without noticing**  
  “Sunk” can sometimes be used with sleep (“sunk into sleep”), but here it is directly connected to “despair,” not to tiredness. The boy is actively upset—crying, wringing his sleeves, calling for his kitten—so sleep is the opposite of what is happening.

2. In the description, “this village was to him a very strange and perplexing place, where people wore fine clothes and had hard hearts,” what is the effect of the phrase “hard hearts” on the tone of the passage?

A. It creates a humorous tone by exaggerating how fancy the townspeople are.  
B. It creates a hopeful tone by showing that the boy admires the townspeople’s strength.  
C. It creates a critical tone by suggesting the townspeople seem cold and uncaring to the boy.*  
D. It creates an excited tone by showing how eager the boy is to explore the village.

**Correct Answer: C. It creates a critical tone by suggesting the townspeople seem cold and uncaring to the boy.*  

**Rationales:**

- **A. It creates a humorous tone by exaggerating how fancy the townspeople are.**  
  While the sentence mentions “fine clothes,” the phrase “hard hearts” does not make the scene funny. Instead, it emphasizes a negative emotional reaction. The boy feels uncomfortable and “wanted to hide,” which does not fit a humorous tone.

- **B. It creates a hopeful tone by showing that the boy admires the townspeople’s strength.**  
  “Hard hearts” has a negative connotation, suggesting emotional coldness, not admirable strength. The boy views the village as “strange and perplexing,” and he is afraid people might laugh at him, which makes the tone uneasy, not hopeful.

- **C. It creates a critical tone by suggesting the townspeople seem cold and uncaring to the boy.*  
  This is correct. “Hard hearts” is figurative language that implies the people are not kind or sympathetic. Combined with the boy’s fear and shyness, the phrase makes the tone critical and somewhat harsh toward the way the village feels to him.

- **D. It creates an excited tone by showing how eager the boy is to explore the village.**  
  The boy is not eager; he is uncomfortable and anxious. Words and phrases like “strange and perplexing,” “shy and awkward,” and “wanted to hide behind things” show that he feels intimidated, so the tone is not excited.

**Standard:** RL.8.4 Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text, including figurative and connotative meanings; analyze the impact of specific word choices on meaning and tone, including analogies or allusions to other texts.

**Item Difficulty:** Medium/Hard

**Item:**

Read the sentence from paragraph 3.

**“She wore a man’s long ulster (not as if it were an affliction, but as if it were very comfortable and belonged to her; carried it like a young soldier), and a round plush cap, tied down with a thick veil.”**

What is the impact of the simile “carried it like a young soldier” on the meaning of the passage?

A. It suggests that the sister feels burdened by the heavy responsibilities of life on the prairie.
B. It implies that the sister is trying to disguise her identity to avoid being recognized by the townspeople.
C. It highlights the sister’s natural resilience and her commanding presence despite the harsh setting.*
D. It indicates that the sister has an aggressive nature and is looking for a conflict with the villagers.

***

**Rationales:**

*   **Option A is incorrect.** This option focuses on a negative connotation of carrying a burden. However, the text explicitly contrasts the simile with the phrase “not as if it were an affliction,” and states the coat felt “very comfortable.” The simile is used to show her strength, not her suffering.
*   **Option B is incorrect.** While the character is wearing a man’s coat and a veil, the text indicates she wears the coat because it is “comfortable” and she walks “resolutely.” There is no evidence in the text that she is attempting to hide who she is; she acts with purpose, not secrecy.
*   **Option C is correct (*).** The standard requires analyzing the impact of word choice. The author uses the simile “like a young soldier” combined with the description that she walked “resolutely” to convey that she is strong, disciplined, and capable. She wears the heavy coat with the ease and confidence of a soldier in uniform, distinguishing her strength from the bleak, “shivering” atmosphere of the town.
*   **Option D is incorrect.** This option misinterprets the connotation of the word “soldier.” While soldiers are associated with fighting, the context of the passage (her wiping the boy’s face, her thoughtful expression) does not support an aggressive or violent tone. The simile refers to her bearing and posture, not a desire for violence.

**Item:**

Read the sentence from the first paragraph.

**“A mist of fine snowflakes was curling and eddying about the cluster of low drab buildings huddled on the gray prairie, under a gray sky.”**

How does the author’s use of the word *huddled* impact the tone of the paragraph?

A. It suggests a tone of communal warmth and safety among the townspeople.
B. It conveys a tone of vulnerability and bleakness in the face of the harsh weather.*
C. It implies a chaotic tone by highlighting the lack of organization in the town's layout.
D. It indicates a mysterious tone by suggesting the buildings are hidden within the mist.

***

**Rationales:**

*   **Option A is incorrect.** While the word “huddled” can sometimes connote intimacy or gathering for comfort, the surrounding context words—such as “drab,” “gray,” and “mist”—describe a cold and cheerless environment. The buildings are not huddled for social warmth, but rather against the elements.
*   **Option B is correct (*).** The author uses the word “huddled” to personify the buildings, describing them as if they are living creatures crowding together to escape the wind and cold. This word choice emphasizes the overpowering nature of the environment and establishes a bleak, desolate tone.
*   **Option C is incorrect.** Although the text later describes the houses as being “set about haphazard,” the word “huddled” specifically refers to the close positioning of the buildings against the weather, not necessarily a lack of planning or chaos.
*   **Option D is incorrect.** The buildings are described as being “drab” and visible on the prairie, not hidden or secretive. The word “huddled” describes their posture or position relative to the cold, not an attempt to conceal themselves.

## Multiple Choice Item

**Read this sentence from the passage:**

*"The dwelling-houses were set about haphazard on the tough prairie sod; some of them looked as if they had been moved in overnight, and others as if they were straying off by themselves, headed straight for the open plain."*

How does the author's use of the word "straying" impact the meaning and tone of this description?

A. It suggests the houses are solidly built and well-established in the community.

B. It creates a sense of disorder by comparing the houses to wandering animals.*

C. It emphasizes how carefully the town was planned and organized.

D. It shows that the houses are moving due to the strong prairie winds.

### Rationales:

**Option A (Incorrect):** A student might choose this if they focus on the fact that houses are present in the town without considering the specific connotation of "straying." However, "straying" implies movement away or wandering, which contradicts the idea of being solidly built or well-established.

**Option B (Correct):** This is correct because "straying" typically refers to animals wandering away from where they belong. By using this word to describe houses, Cather personifies the buildings and creates an image of disorder and impermanence. The word choice reinforces the unsettled, temporary nature of the frontier town, as if even the buildings themselves might wander off into the prairie.

**Option C (Incorrect):** This directly contradicts the text, which explicitly states the houses were "set about haphazard." A student might choose this if they misunderstand the overall meaning of the sentence or don't know what "haphazard" means.

**Option D (Incorrect):** While the passage does mention strong winds, "straying" is used figuratively here to describe how the houses appear, not their literal movement. Students might select this if they interpret the figurative language too literally or connect it too directly to the wind mentioned elsewhere in the passage.

### Final Version:

**Read this sentence from the passage:**

*"The dwelling-houses were set about haphazard on the tough prairie sod; some of them looked as if they had been moved in overnight, and others as if they were straying off by themselves, headed straight for the open plain."*

## Multiple Choice Item

**Read this sentence from the passage:**

*"On the sidewalk in front of one of the stores sat a little Swede boy, crying bitterly. He was about five years old. His black cloth coat was much too big for him and made him look like a little old man."*

What is the impact of the phrase "little old man" in describing the boy's appearance?

A. It emphasizes how mature and responsible the boy acts for his age.

B. It highlights the boy's poverty and vulnerability through an ironic comparison.*

C. It shows that the boy is actually elderly despite being called a child.

D. It suggests the boy is trying to dress like the adults in town.

### Rationales:

**Option A (Incorrect):** Students might choose this if they associate "old man" with maturity and wisdom. However, the context shows the boy is crying, frightened, and helpless—not mature or responsible. The comparison is about physical appearance, not behavior.

**Option B (Correct):** This is correct because the phrase creates a poignant irony—a five-year-old child wearing an oversized coat that makes him look like an old man emphasizes how ill-fitting and inadequate his clothing is. This comparison heightens the sense of the boy's vulnerability and poverty, as he's swimming in hand-me-down clothing that's far too large for his small frame. The juxtaposition of "little" with "old man" creates a touching, somewhat pitiful image.

**Option C (Incorrect):** This represents a literal misreading of figurative language. The text explicitly states "He was about five years old," so students choosing this would be ignoring clear contextual information.

**Option D (Incorrect):** While the boy is wearing adult-sized clothing, the text indicates this is due to poverty (the oversized coat, the much-washed dress), not because he's trying to imitate adults. Students might select this if they miss the socioeconomic implications of the description.

Tier 6b (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7). (6.85 secs). (3839 + 442 = 4281 total tokens)

1. Read the sentence from the passage.

   “It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it **recedes** in the distance.”

   Based on how the word is used in this sentence, what is the most accurate meaning of **recedes**?

   A. To move backward so slowly that it is barely noticeable  
   *B. To seem to move farther and farther away, becoming harder to reach*  
   C. To be taken away suddenly and completely  
   D. To disappear forever without leaving any trace  

   **Rationales**

   - **A. To move backward so slowly that it is barely noticeable**  
     This matches a basic, literal meaning of “recedes” (like water receding slowly), but in the sentence the focus is not on the speed of movement. The phrase “the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance” emphasizes that the approval feels less attainable, not that it is moving slowly. This choice does not fully capture the figurative, emotional sense.

   - **B. To seem to move farther and farther away, becoming harder to reach***  
     This is correct. The narrator is using “recedes in the distance” figuratively to describe how Dr. Blackwell’s approval feels less and less reachable the more she tries. The word choice shapes the tone by suggesting frustration and discouragement, not just physical movement.

   - **C. To be taken away suddenly and completely**  
     This suggests an instant loss, which conflicts with the idea of “the more I seek…the farther it recedes,” which implies a gradual, ongoing change. The word “recedes” here suggests a slow drawing away, not a sudden removal.

   - **D. To disappear forever without leaving any trace**  
     While “recedes” can sometimes lead to eventual disappearance, the sentence does not say the approval is gone forever. It only says it keeps moving “farther…in the distance,” implying that it still exists but is hard to reach. This overstates the meaning and ignores the nuance of the figurative language.

2. Read this sentence from the passage.

   “If I was hoping to find a motherly figure in Dr. Blackwell, I was quickly **disabused** of that notion.”

   How does the word **disabused** contribute to the tone of this sentence?

   A. It shows that the narrator gently changed her mind on her own.  
   *B. It suggests the narrator’s mistaken hope was corrected firmly and somewhat harshly.*  
   C. It indicates that Dr. Blackwell apologized for not acting like a motherly figure.  
   D. It shows that the narrator stopped caring whether Dr. Blackwell was motherly or not.  

   **Rationales**

   - **A. It shows that the narrator gently changed her mind on her own.**  
     This misreads the connotation. “Disabused” implies that someone’s false belief is actively corrected, not that the narrator just slowly or gently changed her mind. It also suggests an outside force (Dr. Blackwell’s behavior), not a purely internal shift.

   - **B. It suggests the narrator’s mistaken hope was corrected firmly and somewhat harshly.*  
     This is correct. “Disabused” carries a connotation of being forced to give up an illusion or false idea. In this context, it emphasizes that the narrator’s hope for a “motherly figure” was strongly and quickly corrected by Dr. Blackwell’s strict behavior, contributing to a tone of disappointment and abrupt awakening.

   - **C. It indicates that Dr. Blackwell apologized for not acting like a motherly figure.**  
     Nothing in “disabused” suggests apology or regret. Instead, it suggests that the belief was shown to be wrong. The passage also shows Dr. Blackwell reprimanding the narrator, not apologizing.

   - **D. It shows that the narrator stopped caring whether Dr. Blackwell was motherly or not.**  
     The word “disabused” focuses on correcting a false belief, not on losing emotional concern. The narrator still clearly cares about Dr. Blackwell’s approval, so this option ignores both the meaning and the emotional context of the word choice.

**Item Alignment:** Common Core State Standard RL.8.4
**Passage:** Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant

**Item:**

Read this sentence from paragraph 8.

“Female physicians are still more of a **curiosity** than anything.”

Based on the paragraph, what is the impact of the author’s use of the word **curiosity**?

A. It emphasizes that female doctors are seen as interesting novelties rather than trusted experts.*
B. It suggests that female doctors are eager to ask questions to understand their patients’ health.
C. It implies that patients are eager to learn from the female doctors because they are rare.
D. It highlights that female doctors are highly valued by the community for their unique skills.

**Rationales:**

*   **Option A is the correct answer.** This option correctly identifies the connotative meaning of "a curiosity" in this specific context. While "curiosity" often refers to a desire to learn, here it is used as a noun to describe an object or person that is strange, unusual, or a spectacle. The surrounding text contrasts this status with being "confident in our abilities," indicating that while the public finds the female doctors interesting to look at (a novelty), they do not yet view them with the seriousness or trust accorded to male doctors.
*   **Option B is incorrect.** This option confuses the noun phrase "a curiosity" (an object or person that is unusual) with the adjective "curious" (having a desire to learn). It incorrectly attributes the trait of inquisitiveness to the doctors, whereas the text describes how the doctors are *perceived* by others.
*   **Option C is incorrect.** This option misattributes the source of the "curiosity." It assumes the word implies the *patients* have a desire to learn from the doctors. However, the text indicates that patients come to the clinic due to financial need ("cannot afford to doubt us") and lack of other options, not because of an intellectual eagerness to learn from the rare female doctors.
*   **Option D is incorrect.** This option relies on a positive connotation of "curiosity" as something rare and therefore valuable (like an antique or a "curio"). However, the context of the paragraph ("I am still not sure our patients are as confident in our abilities") creates a tone of doubt and uncertainty, contradicting the idea that the community highly values their skills at this stage.

**LBIDAT Evaluation:**

*   **Stem & Task (✓):** The stem clearly directs the student to analyze the impact of a specific word choice within the context of the paragraph, aligning perfectly with RL.8.4. It requires understanding the specific, non-literal/nuanced usage of a known word ("curiosity" as a spectacle vs. an emotion).
*   **The Key (✓):** The key is definitively correct based on the textual evidence in paragraph 8, which explicitly contrasts the doctors being a "curiosity" with the patients' lack of "confidence" in them.
*   **Distractors (✓):** The distractors are plausible but definitively incorrect. They represent common errors such as confusing parts of speech/definitions (Option B), misattributing the feeling (Option C), or misinterpreting the tone/connotation (Option D). None are trick questions; all rely on a close reading of the text.
*   **Stimulus (✓):** The stimulus is a grade-appropriate literary passage that supports the item well.

**Item Alignment:** Common Core State Standard RL.8.4
**Passage:** Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant

**Item:**

Read this sentence from paragraph 5.

“That would **extinguish** my hopes, for the Women’s Medical College that Dr. Blackwell has founded here at the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children is the only institution of its kind.”

Based on the sentence, what is the impact of the author’s use of the word **extinguish**?

A. It emphasizes that the narrator views her career ambitions as a vital flame that could be put out forever.*
B. It suggests that the narrator is slowly losing her passion for medicine because of the difficult work.
C. It implies that the narrator believes the Medical College will be forced to close if she makes a mistake.
D. It indicates that the narrator is concerned that the clinic is physically unsafe for the patients.

**Rationales:**

*   **Option A is the correct answer.** The word "extinguish" literally means to put out a fire or light. By applying this word to "hopes," the author uses a metaphor to portray the narrator's ambition as a living flame or spark. The context ("the only institution of its kind") reinforces the idea that if she is sent away, this spark will be completely and permanently snuffed out, justifying the intensity of the word "extinguish."
*   **Option B is incorrect.** This option misinterprets the specific weight of "extinguish." While the narrator is struggling, "extinguish" implies a definitive, forceful end, whereas "slowly losing passion" describes a gradual internal fading. The text indicates she still has the drive ("I know I can do more") but fears being forced out.
*   **Option C is incorrect.** This option is a misreading of the sentence's object. The text states it would extinguish "my hopes," not the college itself. The student confuses the narrator's personal loss with the failure of the institution.
*   **Option D is incorrect.** This option relies on the literal denotation of "extinguish" as it relates to fire and safety. It ignores the figurative application to the abstract concept of "hopes" and incorrectly assumes the narrator is discussing physical hazards in the clinic.

**LBIDAT Evaluation:**

*   **Stem & Task (✓):** The stem directs the student to a specific word within a specific sentence and asks for the *impact* of that usage, which is the core of standard RL.8.4 (analyzing word choice and tone).
*   **The Key (✓):** The key is definitively correct. It captures the metaphorical nature of the word "extinguish" and aligns with the high stakes established in the text (that this is the *only* place she can become a doctor).
*   **Distractors (✓):** The distractors represent distinct types of errors: nuance/degree error (B), misattribution of the object (C), and literal interpretation of figurative language (D). None are trick questions, but all require understanding the specific context.
*   **Stimulus (✓):** The passage provides sufficient context (the rarity of the school, the narrator's desperation) to support the analysis of the word choice.
*   **Fairness (✓):** The item avoids sensitive topics and is accessible to the target grade level.

Looking at this passage and the requirements for RL.8.4, I need to focus on words/phrases that carry meaning beyond their literal definition and impact tone. The item should assess understanding of connotative or figurative meaning, not just vocabulary knowledge.

Here's my item:

In paragraph 4, the narrator says that Dr. Blackwell's approval "recedes in the distance." What does this phrase reveal about the narrator's experience with Dr. Blackwell?

A. The narrator feels that earning Dr. Blackwell's respect becomes increasingly impossible the harder she tries to achieve it.*

B. The narrator believes Dr. Blackwell is physically moving away from her to avoid conversation.

C. The narrator thinks Dr. Blackwell's expectations are unclear and constantly changing.

D. The narrator realizes that Dr. Blackwell prefers to work with more experienced nurses.

**Rationales:**

**Option A (Key):** This is correct. The phrase "recedes in the distance" is used figuratively to show that the more desperately the narrator seeks approval, the more unattainable it seems to become. This creates a tone of frustration and futility, capturing the paradox that her increased effort seems to push the goal further away rather than bringing it closer.

**Option B:** This misinterprets the figurative language as literal. A student selecting this doesn't understand that "recedes in the distance" is being used metaphorically to describe an emotional/professional dynamic, not physical movement.

**Option C:** While this addresses the difficulty of gaining approval, it misses the specific meaning conveyed by "recedes." The phrase doesn't suggest changing expectations but rather something becoming more distant despite (or because of) one's pursuit of it.

**Option D:** This distractor introduces an inference not supported by the figurative language. The phrase "recedes in the distance" specifically relates to the narrator's efforts and their inverse relationship to success, not to Dr. Blackwell's preferences about experience levels.

In paragraph 9, the narrator describes feeling "unjustly reprimanded, like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar." How does this comparison shape the reader's understanding of the relationship between Diana and Dr. Blackwell?

A. It suggests that Diana views Dr. Blackwell as an unreasonably strict authority figure who punishes her for minor, well-intentioned actions.*

B. It reveals that Diana has been stealing medical supplies from the clinic without permission.

C. It shows that Diana believes Dr. Blackwell treats all the nurses like children who cannot be trusted.

D. It indicates that Diana thinks Dr. Blackwell is jealous of her natural nursing abilities.

**Rationales:**

**Option A (Key):** This is correct. The simile compares Diana's feeling to that of a child caught doing something trivially wrong (sneaking sweets), which emphasizes both the power imbalance in their relationship and Diana's sense that the punishment doesn't fit the "crime" of trying to comfort a patient. The word "unjustly" combined with this childlike comparison creates a tone of frustration and diminishment.

**Option B:** This misinterprets the figurative language as literal. A student selecting this doesn't understand that the comparison to "sneaking sweets" is a simile meant to convey Diana's emotional state, not describe actual theft.

**Option C:** While this recognizes the child comparison, it overgeneralizes beyond what the text supports. The simile specifically describes Diana's personal feeling in this moment, not a broader pattern with all nurses.

**Option D:** This distractor introduces an unsupported inference about jealousy. The simile emphasizes Diana feeling small and wrongly criticized, not any suggestion that Dr. Blackwell envies her abilities.

Tier 6b (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7). (6.76 secs). (3895 + 443 = 4338 total tokens)

1. In paragraph 1, the town of Hanover is described as being “anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland.” What is the effect of the word “anchored” in this description?

A. It shows that the town is safely protected from the wind, like a ship tied to a dock.  
B. It suggests that the town is struggling to stay in place against powerful forces around it.*  
C. It explains that the town was built next to a large river used by ships.  
D. It indicates that the town is heavy and cannot be moved, no matter what happens.

**Correct Answer: B***

**Rationales**

- **A. It shows that the town is safely protected from the wind, like a ship tied to a dock.**  
  This takes the ship comparison too literally and focuses only on safety. In the passage, the town is “trying not to be blown away,” so “anchored” emphasizes a struggle against the wind, not a feeling of safety.

- **B. It suggests that the town is struggling to stay in place against powerful forces around it.*  
  This recognizes the figurative use of “anchored.” The town is not literally tied down; instead, the word suggests that it clings to the land while the “howling wind” threatens to blow it away. This choice best explains how the word shapes the tone of hardship and instability.

- **C. It explains that the town was built next to a large river used by ships.**  
  This assumes a literal, nautical meaning that does not match the text. The passage describes a “Nebraska tableland” and a prairie, not a river or harbor, so this is inconsistent with the setting.

- **D. It indicates that the town is heavy and cannot be moved, no matter what happens.**  
  This misreads the tone. The narrator stresses that “None of them had any appearance of permanence,” and the buildings look as if they are “straying off.” The word “anchored” here is ironic and figurative, suggesting a fragile hold, not complete immovability.

2. In paragraph 1, the buildings are described as “huddled on the gray prairie, under a gray sky.” How does the word “huddled” affect the meaning and tone of this description?

A. It suggests that the buildings are carefully lined up in neat, even rows.  
B. It makes the buildings seem frightened and vulnerable, as if they were people crowding together for protection.*  
C. It shows that the buildings are tall and impressive, towering over the prairie.  
D. It explains that the buildings were built very quickly without any planning or thought.

**Correct Answer: B***

**Rationales**

- **A. It suggests that the buildings are carefully lined up in neat, even rows.**  
  This misinterprets “huddled.” The passage later says the houses were set “haphazard,” not in neat rows. “Huddled” implies clustering, not orderly arrangement.

- **B. It makes the buildings seem frightened and vulnerable, as if they were people crowding together for protection.*  
  This recognizes the figurative use of “huddled.” Buildings cannot literally huddle, so the word personifies them, making the town seem small and exposed on the prairie, which adds to the bleak, insecure tone.

- **C. It shows that the buildings are tall and impressive, towering over the prairie.**  
  Nothing in “huddled” suggests height or grandeur. Instead, the word creates an image of low, close-together structures that seem weak rather than impressive.

- **D. It explains that the buildings were built very quickly without any planning or thought.**  
  While the passage does say the houses were set “haphazard,” that idea comes from “haphazard,” not from “huddled.” “Huddled” focuses on how they cluster together, not how quickly or thoughtfully they were built.

**Passage:** Excerpt from *O Pioneers!*

**Item:**

Read the sentence from paragraph 1.

“A mist of fine snowflakes was curling and eddying about the cluster of low drab buildings **huddled** on the gray prairie, under a gray sky.”

What is the impact of the word **huddled** on the meaning of the sentence?

A. It suggests that the buildings are crowded with residents.
B. It implies that the town is secretive and unwelcoming.
C. It portrays the buildings as vulnerable and seeking shelter. *
D. It indicates that the town was built quickly and without a plan.

**Rationales:**

*   **A. It suggests that the buildings are crowded with residents.**
    *   *Rationale:* This distractor is plausible because "huddled" implies a gathering of living things. A student might incorrectly transfer the action from the buildings to the people inside them, assuming the word describes the population density rather than the personified appearance of the structures.
*   **B. It implies that the town is secretive and unwelcoming.**
    *   *Rationale:* This distractor relies on a valid alternative definition of "huddle" (to gather in private consultation or secrecy), which creates a specific tone. However, this definition does not fit the context of the physical description of the landscape and the weather.
*   **C. It portrays the buildings as vulnerable and seeking shelter. (*)**
    *   *Rationale:* This is the correct answer. The author uses personification by applying the word "huddled"—an action typically performed by living things to conserve warmth—to the buildings. In the context of the "mist of fine snowflakes" and the "gray prairie," this word choice emphasizes the town's bleakness, isolation, and struggle against the harsh elements.
*   **D. It indicates that the town was built quickly and without a plan.**
    *   *Rationale:* This distractor is plausible because later in the paragraph, the text describes the houses as "set about haphazard" and looking as if they "moved in overnight." However, the specific word "huddled" refers to the buildings' posture against the cold, not the speed or organization of their construction. This distinguishes students who are analyzing the specific word choice from those relying on general recall of the paragraph.

Read the sentence from paragraph 1.

“One January day, thirty years ago, the little town of Hanover, **anchored** on a windy Nebraska tableland, was trying not to be blown away.”

What is the impact of the word **anchored** on the meaning of the sentence?

A. It suggests that the town is a secure and permanent settlement.
B. It indicates that the town serves as a central hub for the area.
C. It portrays the town as resisting the powerful forces of nature. *
D. It implies that the town is physically connected to a water source.

**Rationales:**

*   **A. It suggests that the town is a secure and permanent settlement.**
    *   *Rationale:* This distractor is plausible because "anchored" typically has a positive connotation of stability and security. However, the context of the sentence (“trying not to be blown away”) and the rest of the paragraph (“None of them had any appearance of permanence”) contradict the idea that the town is secure or permanent.
*   **B. It indicates that the town serves as a central hub for the area.**
    *   *Rationale:* This distractor relies on a common figurative association of an "anchor" as a central or foundational element (e.g., an "anchor store"). However, the text describes the town's physical relationship to the landscape and weather, not its social or economic function within the region.
*   **C. It portrays the town as resisting the powerful forces of nature. (*)**
    *   *Rationale:* This is the correct answer. The author uses the metaphor of an anchor—a tool used to hold a ship in place against currents and storms—to characterize the town's struggle on the "windy Nebraska tableland." It emphasizes the intensity of the wind and the town’s strenuous effort to remain in place.
*   **D. It implies that the town is physically connected to a water source.**
    *   *Rationale:* This distractor appeals to the literal denotative definition of an anchor as a device used in water. A student might select this if they fail to recognize the figurative application of the word to a town located on a dry "tableland" (plateau).

Looking at this passage and the requirements for RL.8.4, I need to find words or phrases that carry connotative or figurative meaning beyond their literal definitions - words that shape tone and meaning in subtle ways.

Let me identify a strong focal point: The phrase "anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland" in the first sentence contains rich figurative language. The word "anchored" is particularly interesting because it's being used metaphorically - towns aren't literally anchored like ships, yet this word choice creates specific connotations about the town's precarious existence.

Here's my item:

---

**Item:**

Read this sentence from the beginning of the passage:

"One January day, thirty years ago, the little town of Hanover, anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland, was trying not to be blown away."

In this context, what does the author's use of the word "anchored" suggest about the town of Hanover?

A. The town has deep historical roots that connect it firmly to its location.

B. The town is barely holding on against the hostile forces of nature.*

C. The town was originally established as a port for river commerce.

D. The town's buildings are constructed with especially strong foundations.

**Rationales:**

**Option A (distractor):** A student might select this if they focus on the positive connotations of "anchored" as something secure and permanent, missing the irony that the author immediately undercuts this with "trying not to be blown away." This represents a misunderstanding of how the word functions in this specific context.

**Option B (key):** This is correct because "anchored" here is used ironically and metaphorically. Ships anchor to stay in place against wind and waves, and the town is similarly trying to hold its position against the harsh prairie winds. The immediate follow-up "trying not to be blown away" reinforces that this "anchoring" is tenuous at best. The word choice creates a tone of vulnerability and impermanence.

**Option C (distractor):** This represents a literal misreading of the metaphor, taking "anchored" to mean the town has maritime connections. While this shows the student recognizes "anchored" as a nautical term, they miss that it's being used figuratively.

**Option D (distractor):** This option takes "anchored" too literally in a construction sense. While anchoring can relate to building foundations, the passage actually suggests the opposite - the buildings "had no appearance of permanence" and wind "blew under them as well as over them."

Looking for another word or phrase with rich connotative meaning that shapes tone, I'll focus on the description of Alexandra's clothing and how she carries herself.

**Item:**

Read this description of Alexandra from the passage:

"She wore a man's long ulster (not as if it were an affliction, but as if it were very comfortable and belonged to her; carried it like a young soldier)..."

What does the phrase "carried it like a young soldier" suggest about Alexandra's character?

A. She has military training that influences how she dresses.

B. She moves with confident purpose despite unconventional circumstances.*

C. She is uncomfortable wearing men's clothing in public.

D. She prefers to dress in a way that intimidates others.

**Rationales:**

**Option A (distractor):** This represents a literal misreading of the simile. The student recognizes the military reference but misses that it's a comparison describing her bearing and attitude, not indicating actual military experience.

**Option B (key):** This is correct. The simile "like a young soldier" conveys pride, confidence, and purposefulness. Combined with the preceding description that she wears the coat "as if it were very comfortable and belonged to her," this comparison suggests Alexandra carries herself with dignity and self-assurance despite wearing what was considered inappropriate clothing for a woman of that era. The military comparison emphasizes strength and determination.

**Option C (distractor):** This directly contradicts the text, which explicitly states she wears it "not as if it were an affliction" and as if it "belonged to her." Students might select this based on assumptions about gender norms rather than the actual connotations in the text.

**Option D (distractor):** While soldiers can be intimidating, this misses the "young" modifier and the overall positive tone of the description. The comparison emphasizes bearing and confidence rather than aggression or intimidation.

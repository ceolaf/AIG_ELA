this standard is not about making inferences or drawing conclusions, and therefore the test taker should not be asked to do either. It has nothing to do with opinions about a passage or its contents—neither the test taker’s nor anyone else’s—and therefore items should not include opinions about text. Items should not ask test takers to identify just *any* evidence that can be found in the text to support an idea about what the text says. They should not ask about the best case that one can build from the text to support what it says explicitly or implicitly.  They should not ask test takers to evaluate or build such cases out of multiple pieces of evidence. Items should not ask about whether a conclusion about what a text says is justified.

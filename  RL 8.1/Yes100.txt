“While there are many skills involved in making sense of and interpreting literary texts, close reading depends on conscious recognition of what a text actually says—either explicitly or implicitly—and how the reader has come to that understanding. That is, the reader must be aware of their own thinking about the meaning of a text and the textual basis for those thoughts—recognizing exactly what in a text may lead a reader to their interpretations and what might constitute the best textual evidence for them. While this most naturally requires test takers to be aware of their own conclusions and their bases, in a testing context we supply them with a particular idea about what a text says explicitly or implicitly, and ask test takers to identify the single best textual support for that idea that exists in the text or select from different proffered candidates that might be the best support.”

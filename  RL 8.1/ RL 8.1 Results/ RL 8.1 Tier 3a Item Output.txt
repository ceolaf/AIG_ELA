Passage: RL 8.1 The Night Circus (MA grade 8 2023 MCAS).txt
Tier 3a (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7). (7.82 secs). (2882 + 498 = 3380 total tokens)

1. Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that Bailey’s desire to return to the circus influences his decision to accept Caroline’s dare?

A. “He had hoped it would stay long enough for him to age properly into old enough, but it vanished without notice after two weeks, leaving too-young Bailey heartbroken.”  

B. “He wonders if he accepted the dare, in part, to return to the circus sooner.” *  

C. “He did not know what tents to choose out of dozens of options, each with tantalizing signs hinting at the contents.”  

D. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”  


Rationales:

- **A. “He had hoped it would stay long enough for him to age properly into old enough, but it vanished without notice after two weeks, leaving too-young Bailey heartbroken.”**  
  This shows Bailey was very upset when the circus left and wanted it to stay, but it does not directly connect his *accepting the dare* to his desire to return. It supports that he loved the circus, not that this love influenced his decision about the dare.

- **B. “He wonders if he accepted the dare, in part, to return to the circus sooner.”*  
  This is the best evidence because it explicitly links Bailey’s decision to accept the dare (“he accepted the dare”) with his motivation to get back to the circus (“to return to the circus sooner”). It directly supports the idea that his desire to return influenced his choice.

- **C. “He did not know what tents to choose out of dozens of options, each with tantalizing signs hinting at the contents.”**  
  This shows Bailey’s confusion and the variety of choices inside the circus, but it does not address why he accepted the dare or how his desire to return affected that decision.

- **D. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”**  
  This supports the idea that Bailey is motivated by curiosity as well as the dare, but it focuses on his feelings once he is already at the fence, not on why he accepted the dare in the first place. It is related but weaker evidence than option B for the specific idea in the question.

Passage: RL 8.1 The Night Circus (MA grade 8 2023 MCAS).txt
Tier 3a (GPT) #2 (temp=0.8). (5.16 secs). (3391 + 426 = 3817 total tokens)

1. Which sentence from the passage best supports the inference that the circus feels less magical and exciting to Bailey during the daytime than it did at night?

A. “If the magic is still there in the daytime, he cannot feel it.” *  

B. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”  

C. “Even the food was amazing. Apples dipped in caramel so dark they appeared almost blackened but remained light and crisp and sweet.”  

D. “There doesn’t even appear to be anyone there, as though the whole place is deserted.”  


Rationales:

- **A. “If the magic is still there in the daytime, he cannot feel it.”*  
  This is the strongest evidence. It directly contrasts the “magic” Bailey felt before with how he feels now in the daytime, clearly supporting the idea that the circus seems less magical and exciting to him during the day.

- **B. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”**  
  This shows Bailey’s curiosity and desire to enter the circus, but it does not compare his nighttime and daytime experiences or say anything about the magic or excitement being weaker.

- **C. “Even the food was amazing. Apples dipped in caramel so dark they appeared almost blackened but remained light and crisp and sweet.”**  
  This describes how wonderful the circus is at night, but it only supports how magical it felt then. It does not address how it feels during the day, so it cannot be the best evidence for the contrast in the question.

- **D. “There doesn’t even appear to be anyone there, as though the whole place is deserted.”**  
  This supports the idea that the circus seems empty and quiet in the daytime, which hints at a less exciting atmosphere, but it does not explicitly connect to Bailey’s sense of lost “magic” as clearly as option A.

Passage: RL 8.1 The Night Circus (MA grade 8 2023 MCAS).txt
Tier 3a (GPT) #3 (temp=0.8). (4.84 secs). (3828 + 500 = 4328 total tokens)

1. Which sentence from the passage best supports the inference that Bailey feels nervous and unsure about going through with the dare as he approaches the circus?

A. “He wonders if he accepted the dare, in part, to return to the circus sooner.”  

B. “It takes Bailey the better part of ten minutes to walk all the way across the field, and the closer he gets, the larger and more intimidating the tents look, and the more his conviction fades.” *  

C. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”  

D. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”  


Rationales:

- **A. “He wonders if he accepted the dare, in part, to return to the circus sooner.”**  
  This sentence explains one of Bailey’s possible motivations for accepting the dare, but it does not show that he is feeling nervous or unsure as he gets closer to the circus. It focuses on his reasons, not his hesitation.

- **B. “It takes Bailey the better part of ten minutes to walk all the way across the field, and the closer he gets, the larger and more intimidating the tents look, and the more his conviction fades.” *  
  This is the strongest evidence. The words “intimidating” and “the more his conviction fades” clearly show that as Bailey nears the circus, his confidence weakens and he becomes less sure about going through with the dare, supporting the inference that he is nervous and uncertain.

- **C. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”**  
  This suggests that Bailey genuinely wants to enter the circus and is motivated by curiosity. It shows interest and desire, not nervousness or doubt, so it does not best support the idea that he is unsure.

- **D. “Bailey looks back across the field. The others are still in the tree, though they look tiny from so far away.”**  
  This shows that Bailey is aware his friends are watching from a distance, but it does not reveal his emotional state about the dare. It neither states nor clearly implies that he feels nervous or uncertain, making it weaker evidence than option B.

Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt
Tier 3a (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7). (7.10 secs). (1019 + 536 = 1555 total tokens)

Item (RL.8.1 – Citing Strongest Textual Evidence)

Stem:  
A student makes the following inference about Jim Bridger:  

“Jim Bridger’s knowledge of the western landforms and routes was so respected that it influenced major transportation developments in the United States.”  

Which sentence from the passage best supports this inference?

A. “When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River.”  

B. “Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.”  

C. “In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains.”  

D.* “In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.”  

---

Rationales:

A. “When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River.”  
- This shows that Bridger participated in exploration and mapping when he was young, but it does not show that his knowledge was respected enough to influence major transportation developments. It supports his early exploration, not the stated inference about national transportation impact.

B. “Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.”  
- This supports the idea that his knowledge was respected and that people trusted him as a guide, but it does not mention any broader influence on “major transportation developments in the United States,” such as railroads or large-scale routes. It is too limited in scope to be the best support.

C. “In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains.”  
- This shows that he discovered an important route, which relates to the idea of landforms and routes, but it does not explicitly connect his discovery to any major, national transportation system. It partially supports the inference but not as strongly as option D.

D.* “In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.”  
- This directly connects Bridger’s route (Bridger’s Pass) to a major transportation development: the Transcontinental Railroad, which crossed the entire country. It most strongly supports the inference that his knowledge of landforms and routes influenced major U.S. transportation developments.

Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt
Tier 3a (GPT) #2 (temp=0.8). (7.69 secs). (1566 + 540 = 2106 total tokens)

Item (RL.8.1 – Citing Strongest Textual Evidence)

Stem:  
A student makes the following inference about Jim Bridger:  

“Jim Bridger’s reputation and personality helped make Fort Bridger an important stopping place for people traveling west.”  

Which sentence from the passage best supports this inference?

A. “Bridger's success at trapping—as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America—led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming.”  

B.* “Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories.”  

C. “He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.”  

D. “These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.”  

---

Rationales:

A. “Bridger's success at trapping—as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America—led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming.”  
- This explains why the fort was built and mentions population movement west, but it does not show that Bridger’s reputation or personality made the fort an important stopping place. It focuses on causes of construction, not the fort’s appeal to travelers.

B.* “Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories.”  
- This directly shows that travelers regularly stopped at the fort and that one reason was to “hear Jim Bridger’s stories,” connecting both his reputation/personality (storytelling) and the fort’s role as a key stopping place. It most strongly supports the inference.

C. “He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.”  
- This shows Bridger’s fame and storytelling ability, supporting the idea of his reputation, but it does not clearly state that this made Fort Bridger an important stopping place for many travelers. It focuses on his fame, not the fort’s importance as a stop.

D. “These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.”  
- This describes the purpose and audience of his stories, showing something about his personality, but it does not show that his personality helped make the fort an important stopping place for travelers in general. It is weaker support than option B.

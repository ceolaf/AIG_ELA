Passage: RL 8.1 The Night Circus (MA grade 8 2023 MCAS).txt
Tier 3a (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7). (7.82 secs). (2882 + 498 = 3380 total tokens)

1. Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that Bailey’s desire to return to the circus influences his decision to accept Caroline’s dare?

A. “He had hoped it would stay long enough for him to age properly into old enough, but it vanished without notice after two weeks, leaving too-young Bailey heartbroken.”  

B. “He wonders if he accepted the dare, in part, to return to the circus sooner.” *  

C. “He did not know what tents to choose out of dozens of options, each with tantalizing signs hinting at the contents.”  

D. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”  


Rationales:

- **A. “He had hoped it would stay long enough for him to age properly into old enough, but it vanished without notice after two weeks, leaving too-young Bailey heartbroken.”**  
  This shows Bailey was very upset when the circus left and wanted it to stay, but it does not directly connect his *accepting the dare* to his desire to return. It supports that he loved the circus, not that this love influenced his decision about the dare.

- **B. “He wonders if he accepted the dare, in part, to return to the circus sooner.”*  
  This is the best evidence because it explicitly links Bailey’s decision to accept the dare (“he accepted the dare”) with his motivation to get back to the circus (“to return to the circus sooner”). It directly supports the idea that his desire to return influenced his choice.

- **C. “He did not know what tents to choose out of dozens of options, each with tantalizing signs hinting at the contents.”**  
  This shows Bailey’s confusion and the variety of choices inside the circus, but it does not address why he accepted the dare or how his desire to return affected that decision.

- **D. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”**  
  This supports the idea that Bailey is motivated by curiosity as well as the dare, but it focuses on his feelings once he is already at the fence, not on why he accepted the dare in the first place. It is related but weaker evidence than option B for the specific idea in the question.

Passage: RL 8.1 The Night Circus (MA grade 8 2023 MCAS).txt
Tier 3a (GPT) #2 (temp=0.8). (5.16 secs). (3391 + 426 = 3817 total tokens)

1. Which sentence from the passage best supports the inference that the circus feels less magical and exciting to Bailey during the daytime than it did at night?

A. “If the magic is still there in the daytime, he cannot feel it.” *  

B. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”  

C. “Even the food was amazing. Apples dipped in caramel so dark they appeared almost blackened but remained light and crisp and sweet.”  

D. “There doesn’t even appear to be anyone there, as though the whole place is deserted.”  


Rationales:

- **A. “If the magic is still there in the daytime, he cannot feel it.”*  
  This is the strongest evidence. It directly contrasts the “magic” Bailey felt before with how he feels now in the daytime, clearly supporting the idea that the circus seems less magical and exciting to him during the day.

- **B. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”**  
  This shows Bailey’s curiosity and desire to enter the circus, but it does not compare his nighttime and daytime experiences or say anything about the magic or excitement being weaker.

- **C. “Even the food was amazing. Apples dipped in caramel so dark they appeared almost blackened but remained light and crisp and sweet.”**  
  This describes how wonderful the circus is at night, but it only supports how magical it felt then. It does not address how it feels during the day, so it cannot be the best evidence for the contrast in the question.

- **D. “There doesn’t even appear to be anyone there, as though the whole place is deserted.”**  
  This supports the idea that the circus seems empty and quiet in the daytime, which hints at a less exciting atmosphere, but it does not explicitly connect to Bailey’s sense of lost “magic” as clearly as option A.

Passage: RL 8.1 The Night Circus (MA grade 8 2023 MCAS).txt
Tier 3a (GPT) #3 (temp=0.8). (4.84 secs). (3828 + 500 = 4328 total tokens)

1. Which sentence from the passage best supports the inference that Bailey feels nervous and unsure about going through with the dare as he approaches the circus?

A. “He wonders if he accepted the dare, in part, to return to the circus sooner.”  

B. “It takes Bailey the better part of ten minutes to walk all the way across the field, and the closer he gets, the larger and more intimidating the tents look, and the more his conviction fades.” *  

C. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”  

D. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”  


Rationales:

- **A. “He wonders if he accepted the dare, in part, to return to the circus sooner.”**  
  This sentence explains one of Bailey’s possible motivations for accepting the dare, but it does not show that he is feeling nervous or unsure as he gets closer to the circus. It focuses on his reasons, not his hesitation.

- **B. “It takes Bailey the better part of ten minutes to walk all the way across the field, and the closer he gets, the larger and more intimidating the tents look, and the more his conviction fades.” *  
  This is the strongest evidence. The words “intimidating” and “the more his conviction fades” clearly show that as Bailey nears the circus, his confidence weakens and he becomes less sure about going through with the dare, supporting the inference that he is nervous and uncertain.

- **C. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”**  
  This suggests that Bailey genuinely wants to enter the circus and is motivated by curiosity. It shows interest and desire, not nervousness or doubt, so it does not best support the idea that he is unsure.

- **D. “Bailey looks back across the field. The others are still in the tree, though they look tiny from so far away.”**  
  This shows that Bailey is aware his friends are watching from a distance, but it does not reveal his emotional state about the dare. It neither states nor clearly implies that he feels nervous or uncertain, making it weaker evidence than option B.

Passage: RL 8.1 The Night Circus (MA grade 8 2023 MCAS).txt
Tier 6a (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7). (6.17 secs). (3134 + 508 = 3642 total tokens)

1. Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that Bailey is still strongly drawn to the circus even after he has gone home?

A. “He could not properly describe it afterward. He could only nod when his mother asked if he had enjoyed himself.”  
B. “They did not stay as long as he would have liked. Bailey would have stayed all night if his parents had let him, there were still so many more tents to explore.”*  
C. “He is already trying to come up with something he can use as proof without having to go in, when he reaches the gates.”  
D. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”

**Correct Answer: B***

**Rationales:**

- **A. “He could not properly describe it afterward. He could only nod when his mother asked if he had enjoyed himself.”**  
  This shows that Bailey had trouble putting his experience into words and that he did enjoy himself, but it does not most strongly support the idea that he is still powerfully drawn back to the circus after leaving.

- **B. “They did not stay as long as he would have liked. Bailey would have stayed all night if his parents had let him, there were still so many more tents to explore.”*  
  This is the best evidence that Bailey remains strongly drawn to the circus. It explicitly states that he wanted to stay all night and emphasizes his desire to keep exploring, clearly showing how much he still wants to be there even after he has to go home.

- **C. “He is already trying to come up with something he can use as proof without having to go in, when he reaches the gates.”**  
  This shows Bailey’s hesitation and his attempt to avoid going back inside, which partly conflicts with the idea of being strongly drawn to the circus; it does not best support the idea that he still longs for it.

- **D. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”**  
  This supports that Bailey wants to enter the circus and is curious, but it refers to his feelings at the field during the dare, not to his strong attraction to the circus after he has already gone home from his first visit. It is not as strong or direct as option B for the stated idea.

Passage: RL 8.1 The Night Circus (MA grade 8 2023 MCAS).txt
Tier 6a (GPT) #2 (temp=0.8). (4.07 secs). (3653 + 397 = 4050 total tokens)

1. Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that Bailey’s earlier heartbreak over the circus disappearing makes him nervous it might leave again?

A. “He had hoped it would stay long enough for him to age properly into old enough, but it vanished without notice after two weeks, leaving too-young Bailey heartbroken.”*  
B. “It arrived only a few days ago and is still a novelty.”  
C. “He wonders if he accepted the dare, in part, to return to the circus sooner.”  
D. “He ached to go back almost the moment he walked away.”

**Correct Answer: A***

**Rationales:**

- **A. “He had hoped it would stay long enough for him to age properly into old enough, but it vanished without notice after two weeks, leaving too-young Bailey heartbroken.”*  
  This sentence directly states that the circus vanished suddenly and that Bailey was “heartbroken,” clearly showing how its earlier disappearance affected him. This explicit description best supports the idea that this past heartbreak would make him nervous it might disappear again.**

- **B. “It arrived only a few days ago and is still a novelty.”  
  This explains that the circus is new and interesting to the town but does not mention Bailey’s earlier heartbreak or any nervousness about it leaving again.**

- **C. “He wonders if he accepted the dare, in part, to return to the circus sooner.”  
  This shows Bailey’s desire to go back quickly, but it does not connect that desire to his earlier heartbreak or to a fear that the circus might vanish again.**

- **D. “He ached to go back almost the moment he walked away.”  
  This sentence shows how strongly Bailey wants to return, but it focuses on his longing, not on his earlier heartbreak or his worry that the circus might disappear as it did before.**

Passage: RL 8.1 The Night Circus (MA grade 8 2023 MCAS).txt
Tier 6a (GPT) #3 (temp=0.8). (4.31 secs). (4061 + 408 = 4469 total tokens)

1. Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that Bailey feels uneasy about being inside the circus during the daytime?

A. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious. Dreadfully, hopelessly curious.”  
B. “If the magic is still there in the daytime, he cannot feel it.”  
C. “It is quieter inside; he cannot hear the birds.”  
D. “Bailey wonders which way he should go, and what might count as proof for his dare.”*

**Correct Answer: D***

**Rationales:**

- **A. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious. Dreadfully, hopelessly curious.”**  
  This sentence emphasizes Bailey’s strong curiosity and desire to enter the circus, not his uneasiness. It does not show him feeling uncomfortable or unsure about being there during the day.

- **B. “If the magic is still there in the daytime, he cannot feel it.”**  
  This sentence shows that the circus feels less magical to Bailey in the daytime, but it does not clearly indicate that he feels uneasy or nervous—only that the feeling is different.

- **C. “It is quieter inside; he cannot hear the birds.”**  
  This describes the quiet atmosphere inside the circus, but it does not directly show Bailey’s feelings about that quiet or that he feels uneasy because of it.

- **D. “Bailey wonders which way he should go, and what might count as proof for his dare.”*  
  This sentence best supports the idea that Bailey is uneasy: he is unsure of which direction to take and is worried about what will “count as proof.” His uncertainty about both his path and his goal reflects his discomfort and lack of confidence about being inside the circus during the daytime.

Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt
Tier 6a (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7). (8.28 secs). (1271 + 575 = 1846 total tokens)

1. Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that Jim Bridger’s knowledge of the western land made him useful to other people?

A. “When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River.”  
B. “Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called ‘pelts.’”  
*C. “Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide.”*  
D. “In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains.”

---

Rationales:

A. “When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River.”  
- This shows that Bridger explored and mapped land, but it does not state that his knowledge made him useful to other people. It supports his early experience, not the idea that others valued and used his knowledge.

B. “Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called ‘pelts.’”  
- This sentence supports the idea that Bridger’s knowledge helped him trap beavers successfully, but it focuses on his own trapping success, not on his usefulness to other people.

*C. “Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide.”*  
- This directly states that Bridger’s knowledge and skills made him “valued,” meaning useful and important to others who hired him as a guide. It is the strongest and most explicit textual evidence for the idea that his knowledge of the land made him useful to people.

D. “In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains.”  
- This shows something important Bridger did, but it does not directly state that this made him useful to others. Readers can infer that the shortcut helped people, but the sentence does not explicitly connect his knowledge to being useful in the way option C does.

Tier 6a (GPT) #2 (temp=0.8). (9.75 secs). (1857 + 527 = 2384 total tokens)

2. Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that Jim Bridger’s stories were not meant to be believed as true?

A. “He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.”  
B. “Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable.”  
C. “He would tell stories of glass mountains, ‘petrified’ birds singing ‘petrified’ songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground.”  
*D. “These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.”*

---

Rationales:

A. “He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.”  
- This shows that Bridger told exaggerated stories, but it does not clearly state that the stories were not meant to be believed; it only says he was famous for “tall tales.”

B. “Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable.”  
- This suggests the stories were exaggerated and hard to believe, but it does not directly say that people understood they were not true or that he did not intend them to be taken as fact.

C. “He would tell stories of glass mountains, ‘petrified’ birds singing ‘petrified’ songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground.”  
- This gives examples of impossible stories, but it still does not explicitly state Bridger’s or the listeners’ understanding that the stories were not true.

*D. “These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.”*  
- This directly states that the locals “knew they weren't true,” clearly supporting the idea that the stories were not meant to be believed as true.

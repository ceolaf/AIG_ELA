Passage: RL 8.1 The Night Circus (MA grade 8 2023 MCAS).txt
Tier 3b (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7). (6.10 secs). (5034 + 529 = 5563 total tokens)

1. Which quotation from the passage best supports the idea that Bailey feels a powerful pull to return to the circus, beyond just wanting to complete the dare?

A. “He is already trying to come up with something he can use as proof without having to go in, when he reaches the gates.”  

B. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious. Dreadfully, hopelessly curious. And beyond proving himself to Caroline and her gang, beneath the curiosity, there is that need to return tugging at him.” *  

C. “Bailey wonders which way he should go, and what might count as proof for his dare.”  

D. “He is halfway home when he realizes he never told the girl his name.”  


Rationales:

A. “He is already trying to come up with something he can use as proof without having to go in, when he reaches the gates.”  
- This shows Bailey thinking about how to complete the dare without entering the circus. It emphasizes his hesitation and desire to avoid going in, not a strong inner pull to return. It does not best support the idea that he feels a powerful need to go back to the circus.

B. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious. Dreadfully, hopelessly curious. And beyond proving himself to Caroline and her gang, beneath the curiosity, there is that need to return tugging at him.” *  
- This directly and explicitly states that Bailey wants to go inside for reasons beyond the dare. It names his “dreadfully, hopelessly” strong curiosity and clearly describes “that need to return tugging at him.” This quotation most strongly supports the idea that Bailey feels a powerful pull to return to the circus.

C. “Bailey wonders which way he should go, and what might count as proof for his dare.”  
- This focuses on Bailey’s concern about how to complete the dare, not on his emotional need to return to the circus. It shows him planning, not feeling a powerful inner pull to go back.

D. “He is halfway home when he realizes he never told the girl his name.”  
- This detail suggests Bailey is still thinking about the girl and the encounter, but it does not clearly connect to a strong desire to return to the circus itself. It is too indirect to be the best evidence for the idea that he feels a powerful pull to go back.

Passage: RL 8.1 The Night Circus (MA grade 8 2023 MCAS).txt
Tier 3b (GPT) #2 (temp=0.8). (5.61 secs). (5574 + 464 = 6038 total tokens)

2. Which quotation from the passage best supports the inference that the circus has a mysterious, almost impossible way of traveling from place to place?

A. “None of the pathways ended, they curved into others or circled back to the courtyard.”  

B. “The tents look surprisingly old and worn in the light, and he wonders how long the circus has been traveling, and where it goes when it leaves.”  

C. “He thinks there must be a circus train, though there is not one at the nearest station, and as far as he can tell, no one ever sees such a train come or go.” *  

D. “The afternoon sun casts long shadows across the tents, stretching over the dry ground.”  


Rationales:

A. “None of the pathways ended, they curved into others or circled back to the courtyard.”  
- This suggests the circus grounds are maze-like and confusing, but it says nothing about how the circus itself travels from place to place. It does not support the inference that its movement is mysterious or impossible.

B. “The tents look surprisingly old and worn in the light, and he wonders how long the circus has been traveling, and where it goes when it leaves.”  
- This shows Bailey wondering about the circus’s history and destinations, but it does not clearly suggest anything impossible or magical about how it travels. It raises questions without giving evidence that its movement is mysterious in a supernatural way.

C. “He thinks there must be a circus train, though there is not one at the nearest station, and as far as he can tell, no one ever sees such a train come or go.” *  
- This directly supports the inference that the circus’s travel is mysterious and seemingly impossible. Bailey assumes a normal explanation (a train) but observes that no one ever sees it arrive or leave, implying that the circus moves in a way that defies ordinary explanation. This is the strongest support for the inference.

D. “The afternoon sun casts long shadows across the tents, stretching over the dry ground.”  
- This is descriptive imagery about light and shadow. It does not relate to how the circus travels or suggest anything about its mysterious arrival or departure, so it does not support the given inference.

Passage: RL 8.1 The Night Circus (MA grade 8 2023 MCAS).txt
Tier 3b (GPT) #3 (temp=0.8). (3.91 secs). (6049 + 385 = 6434 total tokens)

3. Which quotation from the passage best supports the inference that Bailey finds it difficult to describe the circus experience to other people?

A. “He did not know what tents to choose out of dozens of options, each with tantalizing signs hinting at the contents.”  

B. “He could not properly describe it afterward. He could only nod when his mother asked if he had enjoyed himself.” *  

C. “He wonders which way he should go, and what might count as proof for his dare.”  

D. “Bailey stands there for a long while before he walks back across the field.”  


Rationales:

A. “He did not know what tents to choose out of dozens of options, each with tantalizing signs hinting at the contents.”  
- This shows Bailey’s uncertainty about which tents to visit, not his difficulty in talking about the circus later. It does not address describing the experience to others.

B. “He could not properly describe it afterward. He could only nod when his mother asked if he had enjoyed himself.” *  
- This directly states that Bailey “could not properly describe” the circus and shows that he only nods instead of explaining. It is explicit evidence that he finds it hard to describe the experience, making it the strongest support for the inference.

C. “He wonders which way he should go, and what might count as proof for his dare.”  
- This focuses on Bailey planning what to do inside the circus and what he can bring back as proof. It does not show any struggle to explain his experience to someone else.

D. “Bailey stands there for a long while before he walks back across the field.”  
- This suggests Bailey is thinking or reflecting, but it does not specifically concern describing the circus to other people. It is too vague to be strong evidence for the given inference.

Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt
Tier 3b (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7). (8.52 secs). (3171 + 528 = 3699 total tokens)

1. The passage suggests that Jim Bridger’s tall tales were meant to entertain people rather than to be believed as true accounts. Which sentence from the passage best supports this inference?

A. “Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories.”  
B. “He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.”  
C. “These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.” *  
D. “In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area.”

---

Rationales:

**Option A:** “Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories.”  
- Why a student might pick it: It mentions people hearing his stories, which could suggest entertainment.  
- Why it is incorrect: This sentence does not clearly show that the stories were not meant to be believed; it only shows that people listened to them. It does not directly support the idea that the tales were for entertainment rather than truth.

**Option B:** “He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.”  
- Why a student might pick it: It mentions “tall tales,” which are usually exaggerated or untrue, and that he was famous for them.  
- Why it is incorrect: While this sentence hints that the stories were exaggerated, it does not explicitly state that they were meant to entertain rather than be believed. It is weaker evidence than the key because it doesn’t explain the purpose of the tales.

**Option C (Key):** “These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.” *  
- Why it is correct: This sentence directly states that the stories were told to “tease” and “amuse” and that the locals “knew they weren't true.” It most strongly supports the inference that the tales were for entertainment, not to be accepted as true accounts.

**Option D:** “In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area.”  
- Why a student might pick it: A hasty reader might confuse his real knowledge with his storytelling.  
- Why it is incorrect: This sentence is about Bridger’s knowledge of the land and animals, not about his tall tales or whether they were meant to be believed. It does not support the inference about the purpose of his stories.

Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt
Tier 3b (GPT) #2 (temp=0.8). (8.08 secs). (3710 + 495 = 4205 total tokens)

2. The passage implies that Jim Bridger played an important role in helping settlers travel safely through the Rocky Mountains. Which sentence from the passage provides the strongest support for this inference?

A. “In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area.”  
B. “Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide.” *  
C. “Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.”  
D. “He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness.”

---

Rationales:

**Option A:** “In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area.”  
- Why a student might pick it: It connects to his knowledge of the land, which seems related to guiding settlers.  
- Why it is incorrect: This shows that he gained knowledge, but it does not directly state that he used that knowledge to help settlers travel safely. It is background information, not the strongest evidence for his role in helping others.

**Option B (Key):** “Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide.” *  
- Why it is correct: This sentence explicitly explains that his knowledge and skills led him to become a “valued guide,” clearly showing that others relied on him for travel through the mountains. It most directly supports the inference that he played an important role in helping settlers travel safely.

**Option C:** “Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.”  
- Why a student might pick it: A distracted reader might remember Bridger’s success and think it shows his importance.  
- Why it is incorrect: This sentence is about fashion and trade, not about guiding settlers or travel safety. It does not support the inference about his role in helping people cross the Rockies.

**Option D:** “He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness.”  
- Why a student might pick it: It describes an exploration accomplishment and might seem related to travel.  
- Why it is incorrect: This shows a mistake Bridger made while exploring; it does not show him helping settlers or functioning as a guide. It does not support the inference about his importance to travelers.

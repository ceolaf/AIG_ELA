Passage: RL 8.1 The Night Circus (MA grade 8 2023 MCAS).txt
Tier 5b (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7). (9.55 secs). (5209 + 374 = 5583 total tokens)

1. Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that Bailey’s desire to return to the circus is stronger than his fear about sneaking in during the daytime?

A. “It takes Bailey the better part of ten minutes to walk all the way across the field, and the closer he gets, the larger and more intimidating the tents look, and the more his conviction fades.”  

B. “He is already trying to come up with something he can use as proof without having to go in, when he reaches the gates.”  

C. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.” *  

D. “Bailey wonders which way he should go, and what might count as proof for his dare.”  


**Rationales**

- **Option A:** This shows Bailey’s fear and fading conviction, not that his desire to return is stronger than that fear. It does not most strongly support the idea that his desire outweighs his fear.

- **Option B:** This shows Bailey looking for a way to avoid going in, which emphasizes his hesitation more than his strong desire to return. It does not best support the stated idea.

- **Option C (Key):** This sentence explicitly states that Bailey “does, actually, want to go inside” and clarifies that his motivation is “not just because of the dare but because he is curious.” This most strongly supports the idea that his own strong desire (curiosity and wish to return) is driving him more than fear about trespassing.

- **Option D:** This shows Bailey is thinking about directions and what will count as proof for the dare. It focuses on his concern about fulfilling the dare, not on his inner desire to return being stronger than his fear.

Passage: RL 8.1 The Night Circus (MA grade 8 2023 MCAS).txt
Tier 5b (GPT) #2 (temp=0.8). (6.46 secs). (5594 + 367 = 5961 total tokens)

2. The passage suggests that Bailey feels a powerful pull to go back to the circus even after his first visit has ended. Which sentence from the passage best supports this idea?

A. “He had hoped it would stay long enough for him to age properly into old enough, but it vanished without notice after two weeks, leaving too-young Bailey heartbroken.”  

B. “They did not stay as long as he would have liked. Bailey would have stayed all night if his parents had let him, there were still so many more tents to explore.”  

C. “He ached to go back almost the moment he walked away.” *  

D. “He wonders if he accepted the dare, in part, to return to the circus sooner.”  


**Rationales**

- **Option A:** This shows Bailey’s disappointment when the circus disappeared five years earlier, but it focuses on his younger self and that specific moment of heartbreak, not on an ongoing powerful pull to return after his recent visit.

- **Option B:** This indicates that Bailey wanted to stay longer during that night’s visit, but it mainly describes his feelings while he is still at the circus, not the strong desire that continues after he leaves.

- **Option C (Key):** This sentence directly states that “He ached to go back almost the moment he walked away,” clearly showing an intense, immediate longing to return after his first visit has ended. It most strongly supports the idea of a powerful pull to go back.

- **Option D:** This shows Bailey thinking about why he accepted the dare and hints that returning to the circus is one reason, but it is more about his reasoning than about the strength of his desire. It is supportive, but not as strong or direct as Option C.

Passage: RL 8.1 The Night Circus (MA grade 8 2023 MCAS).txt
Tier 5b (GPT) #3 (temp=0.8). (3.42 secs). (5972 + 335 = 6307 total tokens)

3. The passage provides evidence that Bailey feels nervous and unsure about entering the circus during the day. Which sentence from the passage best supports this idea?

A. “Bailey doesn’t know what ‘exsanguinated’ means, but he doesn’t much like the sound of it.”  

B. “It takes Bailey the better part of ten minutes to walk all the way across the field, and the closer he gets, the larger and more intimidating the tents look, and the more his conviction fades.” *  

C. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside.”  

D. “Bailey wonders which way he should go, and what might count as proof for his dare.”  


**Rationales**

- **Option A:** This shows that Bailey is uneasy about the word “exsanguinated,” but it focuses on his reaction to the sign, not clearly on his overall nervousness and uncertainty about entering the circus.  

- **Option B (Key):** This sentence directly shows Bailey’s growing nervousness and doubt: the tents look “intimidating,” and “the more his conviction fades.” It most strongly supports the idea that he feels nervous and unsure about going in.  

- **Option C:** This shows that Bailey wants to go inside and emphasizes his curiosity, which works against the idea of nervous uncertainty rather than supporting it.  

- **Option D:** This indicates that Bailey is thinking about directions and what will count as proof, but it does not clearly show that he feels nervous or unsure about entering; it focuses more on planning than on his emotions.

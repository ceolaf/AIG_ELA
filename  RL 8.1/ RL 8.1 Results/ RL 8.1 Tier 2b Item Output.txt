Passage: RL 8.1 The Night Circus (MA grade 8 2023 MCAS).txt
Tier 2b (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7). (12.54 secs). (4960 + 824 = 5784 total tokens)

1. Which quotation from the passage best supports the inference that Bailey’s desire to return to the circus is stronger than his fear of getting into trouble for trespassing?

A. “Bailey doesn’t know what ‘exsanguinated’ means, but he doesn’t much like the sound of it.”  
B. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious. Dreadfully, hopelessly curious.” *  
C. “He is already trying to come up with something he can use as proof without having to go in, when he reaches the gates.”  
D. “You should probably leave before anyone else sees you,” the girl says, glancing over her shoulder, but Bailey cannot tell what she is looking for.  

**Correct Answer: B***

---

### Rationales

**Option B (Key):**  
“Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious. Dreadfully, hopelessly curious.”  
- This line directly shows Bailey’s strong internal motivation to return to the circus (“dreadfully, hopelessly curious”), going beyond the external pressure of the dare.  
- Because he wants to go in “not just because of the dare,” the text supports the inference that his own desire outweighs the risk of being caught trespassing.  
- It is the strongest, most explicit evidence of his powerful desire to re‑enter the circus.

**Option A (Distractor):**  
“Bailey doesn’t know what ‘exsanguinated’ means, but he doesn’t much like the sound of it.”  
- This shows Bailey’s uneasiness or fear about the threat on the sign.  
- However, it does not show him choosing to act in spite of that fear; it only indicates that the word sounds frightening.  
- It supports the idea that he is nervous, not that his desire is stronger than that fear.

**Option C (Distractor):**  
“He is already trying to come up with something he can use as proof without having to go in, when he reaches the gates.”  
- This line emphasizes Bailey’s reluctance and his attempt to avoid actually entering the circus.  
- It suggests that, at this moment, his fear or hesitation is stronger than his desire, since he’s looking for a way to complete the dare without trespassing.  
- It therefore weakens, rather than supports, the inference in the question.

**Option D (Distractor):**  
“‘You should probably leave before anyone else sees you,’ the girl says, glancing over her shoulder, but Bailey cannot tell what she is looking for.”  
- This quote focuses on the girl’s concern about Bailey being seen and the possible consequences of trespassing.  
- It does not reveal Bailey’s internal conflict or show that his wish to return is stronger than his fear; it’s about her warning, not his motivation.  
- It is relevant to the danger of trespassing, but it does not most strongly support the specific inference about Bailey’s desire overcoming that danger.

Passage: RL 8.1 The Night Circus (MA grade 8 2023 MCAS).txt
Tier 2b (GPT) #2 (temp=0.8). (7.17 secs). (5795 + 667 = 6462 total tokens)

2. Which sentence from the passage best supports the inference that Bailey feels a powerful emotional pull to the circus even after he has left it?

A. “It takes Bailey the better part of ten minutes to walk all the way across the field, and the closer he gets, the larger and more intimidating the tents look, and the more his conviction fades.”  
B. “He could not properly describe it afterward. He could only nod when his mother asked if he had enjoyed himself.”  
C. “He ached to go back almost the moment he walked away.” *  
D. “Bailey stands there for a long while before he walks back across the field.”

**Correct Answer: C***

---

### Rationales

**Option C (Key):**  
“He ached to go back almost the moment he walked away.”  
- The verb “ached” shows a strong, almost physical emotional longing.  
- The phrase “almost the moment he walked away” emphasizes that his desire to return is immediate and intense.  
- This sentence most directly supports the inference that Bailey feels a powerful emotional pull toward the circus even after leaving it.

**Option A (Distractor):**  
“It takes Bailey the better part of ten minutes to walk all the way across the field, and the closer he gets, the larger and more intimidating the tents look, and the more his conviction fades.”  
- This focuses on Bailey’s fading courage as he approaches the circus during the dare.  
- It shows intimidation and doubt, not a strong emotional pull to the circus after leaving it.  
- It does not support the specific inference about his lingering attachment once he is away.

**Option B (Distractor):**  
“He could not properly describe it afterward. He could only nod when his mother asked if he had enjoyed himself.”  
- This shows that Bailey is overwhelmed and somewhat speechless about his experience.  
- While it implies the circus affected him, it does not clearly show an ongoing emotional pull or longing to return.  
- It is weaker evidence for the specific inference than Option C.

**Option D (Distractor):**  
“Bailey stands there for a long while before he walks back across the field.”  
- This indicates that Bailey hesitates or lingers by the fence, which might suggest he is thinking or unsure.  
- However, it does not explicitly show that he feels a powerful emotional pull after leaving the circus grounds.  
- Without the word “ached” or a similar description, this is only indirect, less precise evidence.

Passage: RL 8.1 The Night Circus (MA grade 8 2023 MCAS).txt
Tier 2b (GPT) #3 (temp=0.8). (9.05 secs). (6473 + 721 = 7194 total tokens)

3. Which sentence from the passage best supports the inference that the girl from the circus is cautious about other people discovering Bailey inside the grounds?

A. “She does not say anything more as they walk through the tents, though she makes him stop when they reach a corner and they do not move for almost a minute.” *  
B. “‘You’re not supposed to be here,’ the red-haired girl says quietly.”  
C. “She helps Bailey squeeze through the bars, which are a bit tighter in this part of the fence.”  
D. “The girl smiles. She bites her lip for a second and looks thoughtful, and then she pulls off one of her white gloves and hands it to him through the bars.”

**Correct Answer: A***

---

### Rationales

**Option A (Key):**  
“She does not say anything more as they walk through the tents, though she makes him stop when they reach a corner and they do not move for almost a minute.”  
- This detail shows the girl intentionally pausing and waiting at a corner, suggesting she is checking or listening to make sure the way is clear.  
- Her silence and the long wait indicate careful, cautious behavior so that no one else will see Bailey.  
- This sentence most strongly supports the inference that she is worried about being discovered with him inside the circus.

**Option B (Distractor):**  
“‘You’re not supposed to be here,’ the red-haired girl says quietly.”  
- This shows that the girl knows Bailey is breaking a rule and speaks softly, which could hint at caution.  
- However, it does not clearly show her taking careful actions to avoid being discovered; it is mainly a statement of fact.  
- It is relevant but weaker evidence than Option A, which describes her specific cautious behavior.

**Option C (Distractor):**  
“She helps Bailey squeeze through the bars, which are a bit tighter in this part of the fence.”  
- This shows that the girl helps Bailey escape, but it focuses on the physical action of getting him out.  
- It does not clearly show that she is worried about others seeing him, only that she is assisting him in leaving.  
- The cautious motivation is less evident here than in Option A.

**Option D (Distractor):**  
“The girl smiles. She bites her lip for a second and looks thoughtful, and then she pulls off one of her white gloves and hands it to him through the bars.”  
- This shows the girl being kind and reflective as she decides to give Bailey proof for his dare.  
- It does not relate to her concern about being discovered or to any cautious behavior about others seeing him.  
- It supports an inference about her generosity, not her caution.

Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt
Tier 2b (GPT) #1 (temp=0.7). (7.36 secs). (3097 + 509 = 3606 total tokens)

1. Which sentence from the passage best supports the inference that Jim Bridger’s knowledge of western lands continued to help people even after his lifetime?

A. “He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron.”  
B. “Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide.”  
*C. “In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad.”*  
D. “When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven.”

---

**Rationales**

**Correct Answer: C. “In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad.”**  
- Inference: Bridger’s discoveries had a lasting impact beyond his own lifetime.  
- The sentence shows that Bridger’s Pass was later used by the Union Pacific Railroad, part of the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.  
- This indicates his knowledge of western routes continued to benefit travel and transportation long after he first found the pass, directly supporting the inference about ongoing impact.

**A. “He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron.”**  
- This detail is about his early training as a blacksmith.  
- It does not show any long-term or lasting effect of his knowledge on others after his lifetime.  
- A student choosing this might be focusing on “knowledge” in general rather than on evidence that supports the specific inference about long-term impact.

**B. “Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide.”**  
- This sentence shows that his knowledge helped people during his life, as he guided travelers across the mountains.  
- It does not show that his knowledge continued to help people after he was gone.  
- A student might pick this because it connects “knowledge” and “helping people,” but it does not support the “even after his lifetime” part of the inference.

**D. “When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven.”**  
- This sentence gives factual information about his retirement and death.  
- It does not mention his knowledge, western lands, or any ongoing impact.  
- A student might choose this if they are thinking about his “lifetime” literally, but it does not support the idea that his influence continued beyond his life.

Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt
Tier 2b (GPT) #2 (temp=0.8). (8.44 secs). (3617 + 490 = 4107 total tokens)

2. Which sentence from the passage best supports the inference that Jim Bridger’s discoveries helped make travel across the West easier for many people?

A. “He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.”  
B. “Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide.”  
*C. “Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it.”*  
D. “Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.”

---

**Rationales**

**Correct Answer: C. “Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it.”**  
- Inference: Bridger’s discoveries made western travel easier.  
- This sentence explicitly states that Bridger’s Pass shortened trips and that settlers “frequently used it,” showing his discovery directly improved travel for many people.  
- It is the strongest evidence connecting his actions (finding the pass) to easier travel for a large number of settlers.

**A. “He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.”**  
- Focuses on his storytelling and fame, not on travel becoming easier.  
- While it mentions “people passing through,” it is about entertainment, not improved travel conditions.  
- A student might be distracted by the mention of travelers but this does not support the specific inference about making travel easier.

**B. “Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide.”**  
- Shows that Bridger helped people travel by guiding them, but it does not show that his *discoveries* changed travel for many.  
- This evidence is more about his personal role as a guide than about a discovery that broadly eased travel (like the pass).  
- A student might choose this because it connects to travel, but it is not as strong as C in supporting the inference about easing travel for many people.

**D. “Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.”**  
- Shows that Bridger is honored and remembered, not that he made travel easier.  
- It is about his legacy in naming, not about the practical impact of his discoveries on travel.  
- A student might think “honor” implies importance, but this does not specifically support the inference about making western travel easier.

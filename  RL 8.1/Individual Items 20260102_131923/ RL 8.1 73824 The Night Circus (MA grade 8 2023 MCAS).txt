### Rationales

**A. “She is standing in the middle of the path between the tents, just standing there as though she is waiting for him.”**  
- This suggests that the girl might be expecting Bailey, or at least is not surprised to see him.  
- It does not show that she is worried or cautious about him being discovered.  
- There is no mention of other people or any concern about being seen.

**B. “You should probably leave before anyone else sees you,” the girl says, glancing over her shoulder, but Bailey cannot tell what she is looking for.”***  
- This directly shows her concern that “anyone else” might see Bailey, which indicates she is cautious about him being discovered.  
- Her glancing over her shoulder reinforces the idea that she is checking for others and being careful.  
- This is the strongest and most explicit evidence that she is worried about him being found inside the circus.

**C. “The girl takes his hand in her white-gloved one and pulls him down one of the passageways.”**  
- This shows that she is leading him somewhere, possibly to help him.  
- While it might suggest she wants to move him quickly, it does not clearly show *why* (no mention of others or being seen), so it is weaker evidence of caution.  
- The sentence lacks the explicit reference to being seen that makes B stronger.

**D. “She helps Bailey squeeze through the bars, which are a bit tighter in this part of the fence.”**  
- This shows that she is helping him escape, but it focuses on the physical action of getting through the fence.  
- It does not directly show her concern about being discovered by others; that motive has to be guessed.  
- Compared with B, it is less direct as evidence of her cautious attitude.

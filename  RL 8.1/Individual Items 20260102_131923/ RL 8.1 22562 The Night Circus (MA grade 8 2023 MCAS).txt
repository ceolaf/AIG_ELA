1. Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that Bailey still longs to spend more time at the circus even after his first visit is over?

A. “He could only stare from afar, enchanted, at the tents and the lights.”  
B. “He could not properly describe it afterward.”  
*C. “He ached to go back almost the moment he walked away.”*  
D. “He wonders if he accepted the dare, in part, to return to the circus sooner.”

**Rationales**

- **Option A:** This shows Bailey’s strong interest in the circus when he is too young to visit, but it does not refer to how he feels after his first proper visit is over. It is not the strongest support for the specific idea that he still longs to spend more time there afterward.

- **Option B:** This sentence shows that Bailey has trouble describing the circus, but it says nothing about him wanting to return or spend more time there, so it does not directly support the stated idea.

- **Option C (Key):** This sentence explicitly states that Bailey “ached to go back almost the moment he walked away,” directly and strongly supporting the idea that he still longs to spend more time at the circus after his first visit ends.

- **Option D:** This suggests that Bailey may have accepted the dare partly to return sooner, which implies a desire to go back, but it is less direct and less strong than option C. It focuses on his possible reason for accepting the dare rather than clearly stating his longing right after leaving.

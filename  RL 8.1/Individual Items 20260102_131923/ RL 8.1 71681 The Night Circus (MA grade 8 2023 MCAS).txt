A. “Bailey doesn’t know what ‘exsanguinated’ means, but he doesn’t much like the sound of it.”  
B. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious. Dreadfully, hopelessly curious.” *  
C. “He is already trying to come up with something he can use as proof without having to go in, when he reaches the gates.”

### Rationales

**Option B (Key):**  
“Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious. Dreadfully, hopelessly curious.”  
- This line directly shows Bailey’s strong internal motivation to return to the circus (“dreadfully, hopelessly curious”), going beyond the external pressure of the dare.  
- Because he wants to go in “not just because of the dare,” the text supports the inference that his own desire outweighs the risk of being caught trespassing.  
- It is the strongest, most explicit evidence of his powerful desire to re‑enter the circus.

**Option A (Distractor):**  
“Bailey doesn’t know what ‘exsanguinated’ means, but he doesn’t much like the sound of it.”  
- This shows Bailey’s uneasiness or fear about the threat on the sign.  
- However, it does not show him choosing to act in spite of that fear; it only indicates that the word sounds frightening.  
- It supports the idea that he is nervous, not that his desire is stronger than that fear.

**Option C (Distractor):**  
“He is already trying to come up with something he can use as proof without having to go in, when he reaches the gates.”  
- This line emphasizes Bailey’s reluctance and his attempt to avoid actually entering the circus.  
- It suggests that, at this moment, his fear or hesitation is stronger than his desire, since he’s looking for a way to complete the dare without trespassing.  
- It therefore weakens, rather than supports, the inference in the question.

**Option D (Distractor):**  
“‘You should probably leave before anyone else sees you,’ the girl says, glancing over her shoulder, but Bailey cannot tell what she is looking for.”  
- This quote focuses on the girl’s concern about Bailey being seen and the possible consequences of trespassing.  
- It does not reveal Bailey’s internal conflict or show that his wish to return is stronger than his fear; it’s about her warning, not his motivation.  
- It is relevant to the danger of trespassing, but it does not most strongly support the specific inference about Bailey’s desire overcoming that danger.

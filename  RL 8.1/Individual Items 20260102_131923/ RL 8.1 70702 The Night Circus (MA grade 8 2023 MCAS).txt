2. Which sentence from the passage best supports the inference that Bailey feels nervous and unsure about going through with the dare once he reaches the circus?

A. “He had hoped it would stay long enough for him to age properly into old enough, but it vanished without notice after two weeks, leaving too-young Bailey heartbroken.”  
B. “He ached to go back almost the moment he walked away.”  
C. “It takes Bailey the better part of ten minutes to walk all the way across the field, and the closer he gets, the larger and more intimidating the tents look, and the more his conviction fades.” *  
D. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”

**Correct Answer: C***

**Rationales:**

- **Option A:**  
  This shows Bailey’s sadness when the circus left years ago, supporting the idea that he cared deeply about it. It does not show how he feels now about going through with the dare or suggest nervousness or uncertainty at the present moment.

- **Option B:**  
  This sentence shows Bailey’s strong desire to return to the circus after his earlier visit (“He ached to go back almost the moment he walked away”). It supports an inference about longing, not about feeling nervous or unsure when he approaches the circus to complete the dare.

- **Option C (Correct):**  
  This sentence directly connects Bailey’s approach to the circus with his growing fear and doubt: “the closer he gets, the larger and more intimidating the tents look, and the more his conviction fades.” The words “intimidating” and “his conviction fades” clearly support the inference that he feels nervous and unsure about continuing with the dare.

- **Option D:**  
  This sentence shows that Bailey genuinely wants to go inside and that curiosity motivates him. While it reveals mixed motivations (not only the dare), it does not indicate nervousness or uncertainty; instead, it suggests interest and desire. Therefore, it is weaker evidence for the specific inference about him feeling nervous and unsure than option C.

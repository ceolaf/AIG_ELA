1. Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that Bailey feels uneasy about being inside the circus during the daytime?

A. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious. Dreadfully, hopelessly curious.”  
B. “If the magic is still there in the daytime, he cannot feel it.”  
C. “It is quieter inside; he cannot hear the birds.”  
D. “Bailey wonders which way he should go, and what might count as proof for his dare.”*

**Correct Answer: D***

**Rationales:**

- **A. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious. Dreadfully, hopelessly curious.”**  
  This sentence emphasizes Bailey’s strong curiosity and desire to enter the circus, not his uneasiness. It does not show him feeling uncomfortable or unsure about being there during the day.

- **B. “If the magic is still there in the daytime, he cannot feel it.”**  
  This sentence shows that the circus feels less magical to Bailey in the daytime, but it does not clearly indicate that he feels uneasy or nervous—only that the feeling is different.

- **C. “It is quieter inside; he cannot hear the birds.”**  
  This describes the quiet atmosphere inside the circus, but it does not directly show Bailey’s feelings about that quiet or that he feels uneasy because of it.

- **D. “Bailey wonders which way he should go, and what might count as proof for his dare.”*  
  This sentence best supports the idea that Bailey is uneasy: he is unsure of which direction to take and is worried about what will “count as proof.” His uncertainty about both his path and his goal reflects his discomfort and lack of confidence about being inside the circus during the daytime.

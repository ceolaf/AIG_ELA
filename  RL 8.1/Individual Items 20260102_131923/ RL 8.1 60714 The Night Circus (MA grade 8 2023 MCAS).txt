3. Which sentence from the passage best supports the inference that the girl is willing to help Bailey even though she knows he is breaking the rules?

A. “You’re not supposed to be here,” the red-haired girl says quietly.  
B. “You should probably leave before anyone else sees you,” the girl says, glancing over her shoulder, but Bailey cannot tell what she is looking for. *  
C. “But you should be more careful. You’re not supposed to come in here during the day, it’s trespassing.”  
D. “The girl smiles. She bites her lip for a second and looks thoughtful, and then she pulls off one of her white gloves and hands it to him through the bars.”

**Correct Answer: B***

**Rationales:**

- **Option A:**  
  This shows that the girl recognizes Bailey is not allowed to be there, but it only states the rule. It does not show that she is willing to help him; it simply identifies that he is somewhere he shouldn’t be.

- **Option B (Correct):**  
  This sentence shows both her awareness of the rules and her decision to help: she tells him to leave “before anyone else sees you” and looks over her shoulder, suggesting she is protecting him from being caught. This most strongly supports the inference that she is willing to help even though she knows he is trespassing.

- **Option C:**  
  Here she warns him about trespassing, which reinforces that she knows he is breaking the rules. However, it focuses on scolding and warning rather than on helping or protecting him, so it is weaker evidence for the inference than option B.

- **Option D:**  
  Giving Bailey the glove shows that she is kind and willing to help him complete his dare, but this sentence alone does not clearly connect that kindness to her awareness that he is breaking rules. It supports her generosity more than her decision to help despite knowing he is trespassing.

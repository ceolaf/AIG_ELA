### Rationales

**A. “He had hoped it would stay long enough for him to age properly into old enough, but it vanished without notice after two weeks, leaving too-young Bailey heartbroken.”**  
- This shows that Bailey was sad when the circus left five years earlier, so it supports that he cared about the circus in the past.  
- However, the question asks for evidence that supports an inference about his *current* strong pull to return “beyond just wanting to complete the dare.”  
- This sentence is background information, not the clearest evidence of his present motivation.

**B. “He wonders if he accepted the dare, in part, to return to the circus sooner.”***  
- This directly supports the inference that Bailey feels a strong inner desire to go back to the circus that goes beyond the dare itself.  
- The phrase “in part” shows that the dare is only one reason; another reason is his own wish to return.  
- This sentence most clearly connects his actions (accepting the dare) with his internal motivation (wanting to return), which is exactly what the question asks about.

**C. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”**  
- This shows that Bailey is motivated by curiosity as well as the dare.  
- It supports an inference that his interest is more than just the dare, but it focuses on curiosity in the moment rather than the deeper, ongoing pull to *return* to the circus.  
- Choice B more strongly and directly links his acceptance of the dare to the desire to return.

**D. “He ached to go back almost the moment he walked away.”**  
- This shows a strong emotional reaction right after he left the circus previously, supporting that he really wanted to return at that time.  
- However, it does not explain his motivation for accepting the dare now, which is what the question targets.  
- It supports his feelings in the past, but B more strongly supports the specific inference about why he takes the dare and his present pull to return.

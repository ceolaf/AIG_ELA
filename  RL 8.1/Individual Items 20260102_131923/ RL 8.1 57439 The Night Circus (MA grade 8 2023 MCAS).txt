### Rationales

**Option A (Key):**  
“She does not say anything more as they walk through the tents, though she makes him stop when they reach a corner and they do not move for almost a minute.”  
- This detail shows the girl intentionally pausing and waiting at a corner, suggesting she is checking or listening to make sure the way is clear.  
- Her silence and the long wait indicate careful, cautious behavior so that no one else will see Bailey.  
- This sentence most strongly supports the inference that she is worried about being discovered with him inside the circus.

**Option B (Distractor):**  
“‘You’re not supposed to be here,’ the red-haired girl says quietly.”  
- This shows that the girl knows Bailey is breaking a rule and speaks softly, which could hint at caution.  
- However, it does not clearly show her taking careful actions to avoid being discovered; it is mainly a statement of fact.  
- It is relevant but weaker evidence than Option A, which describes her specific cautious behavior.

**Option C (Distractor):**  
“She helps Bailey squeeze through the bars, which are a bit tighter in this part of the fence.”  
- This shows that the girl helps Bailey escape, but it focuses on the physical action of getting him out.  
- It does not clearly show that she is worried about others seeing him, only that she is assisting him in leaving.  
- The cautious motivation is less evident here than in Option A.

**Option D (Distractor):**  
“The girl smiles. She bites her lip for a second and looks thoughtful, and then she pulls off one of her white gloves and hands it to him through the bars.”  
- This shows the girl being kind and reflective as she decides to give Bailey proof for his dare.  
- It does not relate to her concern about being discovered or to any cautious behavior about others seeing him.  
- It supports an inference about her generosity, not her caution.

3. Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that Bailey cannot feel the circus’s magic during the daytime?

A. “Bailey doesn’t know what ‘exsanguinated’ means, but he doesn’t much like the sound of it.”  
B. “If the magic is still there in the daytime, he cannot feel it.”*  
C. “There doesn’t even appear to be anyone there, as though the whole place is deserted.”  
D. “The circus feels strange in the daytime, too quiet.”

**Rationales**

- **Option A:** This shows Bailey is unsure about the meaning of a word on the sign and that it bothers him, but it does not mention the circus’s magic or how it feels in the daytime.

- **Option B (Key):** This sentence directly states, “If the magic is still there in the daytime, he cannot feel it,” which explicitly supports the idea that Bailey cannot feel the circus’s magic during the day.

- **Option C:** This shows the circus seems empty and deserted, which contributes to the daytime atmosphere but does not clearly state that Bailey cannot feel any magic.

- **Option D:** This indicates that the circus feels “strange” and “too quiet” in the daytime, suggesting a different mood, but it is less direct than option B about Bailey’s inability to feel the magic.

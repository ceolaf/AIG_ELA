### Rationales

- **A. “He could not properly describe it afterward. He could only nod when his mother asked if he had enjoyed himself.”**  
  - This shows that Bailey is overwhelmed and unable to put the experience into words, but it does not clearly state that he still feels the circus is magical after leaving. It focuses on his difficulty describing it, not on his ongoing sense of magic.

- **B. “He ached to go back almost the moment he walked away.”***  
  - This best supports the idea that the magic of the circus lingers for Bailey even after he leaves. The phrase “ached to go back” shows a strong emotional pull that continues beyond his time at the circus, implying that its magical effect remains with him.

- **C. “He wonders if he accepted the dare, in part, to return to the circus sooner.”**  
  - This indicates that Bailey wants to return, but it ties that desire to the dare and to his decision-making. It does not directly show that he still experiences the circus as magical after leaving; it focuses on his motives for accepting the dare.

- **D. “The circus feels strange in the daytime, too quiet.”**  
  - This describes how the circus seems during the day, emphasizing that it feels “strange” and “too quiet.” It does not show that Bailey still feels it is magical after he has left an earlier visit; instead, it contrasts the nighttime magic with the daytime atmosphere.

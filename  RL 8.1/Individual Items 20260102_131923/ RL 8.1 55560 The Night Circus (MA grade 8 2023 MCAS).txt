2. Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that Bailey is still deeply affected by the circus’s earlier disappearance from his town?

A. “He had hoped it would stay long enough for him to age properly into old enough, but it vanished without notice after two weeks, leaving too-young Bailey heartbroken.” *  
B. “It arrived only a few days ago and is still a novelty.”  
C. “He ached to go back almost the moment he walked away.”  
D. “He wonders if he accepted the dare, in part, to return to the circus sooner.”  

**Correct Answer: A*  

**Rationales**

- **A. “He had hoped it would stay long enough for him to age properly into old enough, but it vanished without notice after two weeks, leaving too-young Bailey heartbroken.” *  
  This sentence explicitly states that the circus’s earlier disappearance left Bailey “heartbroken,” directly showing how strongly it affected him. It is the strongest textual evidence that the earlier vanishing of the circus had a deep emotional impact on him.

- **B. “It arrived only a few days ago and is still a novelty.”  
  This describes how recently the circus has returned and that it is new and exciting to the town. It does not show Bailey’s lingering emotional reaction to its earlier disappearance.

- **C. “He ached to go back almost the moment he walked away.”  
  This shows Bailey’s strong desire to return after his most recent visit, but it relates to the present visit, not to the earlier time when the circus vanished from town years before.

- **D. “He wonders if he accepted the dare, in part, to return to the circus sooner.”  
  This suggests Bailey’s current motivation to go back to the circus. While it implies he wants to return, it does not directly show how the earlier disappearance affected him emotionally.

3. Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that Bailey is surprised that the circus feels ordinary when he sneaks in during the day?

A. “If the magic is still there in the daytime, he cannot feel it.”*  
B. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside.”  
C. “And it seems to be completely abandoned, with no sign of any workers or performers.”  
D. “The circus feels strange in the daytime, too quiet.”

**Correct Answer: A***

**Rationales:**

- **A. “If the magic is still there in the daytime, he cannot feel it.”***  
  This directly shows that Bailey expects the circus to feel magical (as it did at night) but is surprised that it does not feel that way now. The contrast between his expectation of “magic” and his current experience (“he cannot feel it”) best supports the idea that it seems ordinary to him in the daytime.

- **B. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside.”**  
  This shows Bailey’s desire and curiosity about the circus, but it does not show any surprise about how the circus feels once he is inside during the day.

- **C. “And it seems to be completely abandoned, with no sign of any workers or performers.”**  
  This supports the idea that the circus looks empty, but not specifically that Bailey is surprised it feels ordinary or less magical. It describes what he sees, not his reaction compared to his expectations.

- **D. “The circus feels strange in the daytime, too quiet.”**  
  This shows that the circus feels “strange” and quiet, but it does not clearly express Bailey’s surprise that it lacks the magic he expected. Option A more strongly and explicitly connects his expectations of magic with his realization that it feels ordinary.

2. Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that Bailey feels nervous about going back into the circus during the day?

A. “He is already trying to come up with something he can use as proof without having to go in, when he reaches the gates.”*  
B. “He finds that he does, actually, want to go inside.”  
C. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”  
D. “Bailey wonders which way he should go, and what might count as proof for his dare.”

**Rationales**

- **Option A (Key):** This sentence clearly shows Bailey “trying to come up with something he can use as proof without having to go in,” which directly supports the idea that he is nervous about entering the circus again during the day.

- **Option B:** This sentence shows that Bailey wants to go inside, which points to his curiosity rather than his nervousness. It does not support the idea that he feels uneasy about going back in.

- **Option C:** Like option B, this focuses on Bailey’s curiosity and desire to go inside “not just because of the dare,” but it does not indicate that he is nervous or reluctant.

- **Option D:** This shows Bailey is uncertain about where to go and what will count as proof, which suggests confusion or indecision, but not necessarily nervousness about entering the circus itself. It is weaker support for the specific idea in the question than option A.

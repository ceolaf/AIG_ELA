1. Which sentence from the passage best supports the inference that Bailey’s desire to return to the circus affects his decision to accept the dare?

A. “He had hoped it would stay long enough for him to age properly into old enough, but it vanished without notice after two weeks, leaving too-young Bailey heartbroken.”  
B. “He ached to go back almost the moment he walked away.”  
C. “He wonders if he accepted the dare, in part, to return to the circus sooner.” *  
D. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”

**Correct Answer: C***

**Rationales:**

- **Option A:**  
  This shows that Bailey was heartbroken when the circus left years earlier, which explains his long‑standing attachment to the circus. However, it does not directly show that this desire influences his decision to accept the current dare. It supports his feelings about the circus, not the specific inference about why he accepts the dare.

- **Option B:**  
  This sentence shows Bailey’s strong desire to return right after his first recent visit (“He ached to go back almost the moment he walked away”), but it does not explicitly connect that desire to his choice to accept the dare. It supports the idea that he wants to go back, but not clearly that this desire affects his decision about the dare.

- **Option C (Correct):**  
  This sentence directly links Bailey’s decision about the dare to his wish to return to the circus: “He wonders if he accepted the dare, in part, to return to the circus sooner.” It explicitly states the connection the question asks about—his desire to return influences his choice—so it is the strongest textual evidence for the inference.

- **Option D:**  
  This sentence shows that Bailey has multiple reasons for wanting to go inside the circus (“Not just because of the dare but because he is curious”), which supports an inference about his curiosity and mixed motivations. However, it does not mention the decision to accept the dare or clearly tie that decision to his wish to return, so it is weaker evidence for the specific inference in the question than option C.

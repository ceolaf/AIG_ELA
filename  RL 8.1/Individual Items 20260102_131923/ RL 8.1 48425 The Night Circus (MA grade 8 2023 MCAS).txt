### Rationales

**A. “He did not know what tents to choose out of dozens of options, each with tantalizing signs hinting at the contents.”**  
- This shows that Bailey is overwhelmed by the number of choices and curious about what’s inside the tents.  
- It supports the idea that the circus is exciting and full of possibilities, but it doesn’t clearly show that it’s *difficult to navigate* or confusing.  
- The focus is on decision-making, not on getting lost or turned around.

**B. “He is already trying to come up with something he can use as proof without having to go in, when he reaches the gates.”**  
- This shows Bailey’s hesitation and nervousness about going into the circus.  
- It supports an inference about his fear or reluctance, not about the circus being mysterious or hard to find one’s way through.  
- It deals with his feelings before entering, not with the layout or navigation inside.

**C. “Bailey turns right at the end of the passage, and finds himself in a row of tents, each with a door and a sign advertising its contents.”**  
- This describes a clear row of tents with labeled doors and signs, which actually makes the circus seem more organized and understandable.  
- It does not support the idea that the circus is confusing or difficult to navigate.  
- It is neutral description rather than evidence of mystery or disorientation.

**D. “Bailey turns around but cannot tell which way he came, the path turns in on itself and he cannot see any of the signs to know which ones he had passed.”***  
- This directly shows that Bailey is confused and disoriented inside the circus: he “cannot tell which way he came.”  
- The phrase “the path turns in on itself” suggests a maze-like, mysterious layout that is hard to navigate.  
- This sentence most strongly supports the inference that the circus is mysterious and difficult to find one’s way through, even for Bailey, who has visited before.

1. Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that Bailey is still strongly drawn to the circus even after he has gone home?

A. “He could not properly describe it afterward. He could only nod when his mother asked if he had enjoyed himself.”  
B. “They did not stay as long as he would have liked. Bailey would have stayed all night if his parents had let him, there were still so many more tents to explore.”*  
C. “He is already trying to come up with something he can use as proof without having to go in, when he reaches the gates.”  
D. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”

**Correct Answer: B***

**Rationales:**

- **A. “He could not properly describe it afterward. He could only nod when his mother asked if he had enjoyed himself.”**  
  This shows that Bailey had trouble putting his experience into words and that he did enjoy himself, but it does not most strongly support the idea that he is still powerfully drawn back to the circus after leaving.

- **B. “They did not stay as long as he would have liked. Bailey would have stayed all night if his parents had let him, there were still so many more tents to explore.”*  
  This is the best evidence that Bailey remains strongly drawn to the circus. It explicitly states that he wanted to stay all night and emphasizes his desire to keep exploring, clearly showing how much he still wants to be there even after he has to go home.

- **C. “He is already trying to come up with something he can use as proof without having to go in, when he reaches the gates.”**  
  This shows Bailey’s hesitation and his attempt to avoid going back inside, which partly conflicts with the idea of being strongly drawn to the circus; it does not best support the idea that he still longs for it.

- **D. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”**  
  This supports that Bailey wants to enter the circus and is curious, but it refers to his feelings at the field during the dare, not to his strong attraction to the circus after he has already gone home from his first visit. It is not as strong or direct as option B for the stated idea.

Which sentence from the passage best supports the inference that Bailey feels nervous and out of place when he is caught inside the circus during the day?

A. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”  

B. “Bailey doesn’t know what ‘exsanguinated’ means, but he doesn’t much like the sound of it.”  

*C. “ ‘I . . . uh, I know,’ he says, and it sounds to him like the stupidest thing in the world to say, but the girl only looks at him.”*  

D. “Bailey wonders which way he should go, and what might count as proof for his dare.”  


### Rationales

- **Option A:** “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”  
  - *Why a student might pick it:* It clearly shows Bailey’s curiosity and desire to enter, which might be mistaken for nervous excitement.  
  - *Why it’s wrong:* This sentence focuses on his motivation and curiosity before he goes in, not his feelings of nervousness or discomfort when he is actually confronted inside.

- **Option B:** “Bailey doesn’t know what ‘exsanguinated’ means, but he doesn’t much like the sound of it.”  
  - *Why a student might pick it:* It shows he is uneasy about the warning on the sign, which relates to fear.  
  - *Why it’s wrong:* This line shows generalized worry about the word on the sign, not the specific moment when he feels awkward and out of place after being discovered by the girl.

- **Option C (Key):** “ ‘I . . . uh, I know,’ he says, and it sounds to him like the stupidest thing in the world to say, but the girl only looks at him.”  
  - *Why it’s correct:* This sentence directly reveals Bailey’s self-consciousness and discomfort. His stammering (“I . . . uh”) and his thought that what he said sounds “like the stupidest thing in the world” show he feels nervous and out of place when the girl confronts him inside the circus.

- **Option D:** “Bailey wonders which way he should go, and what might count as proof for his dare.”  
  - *Why a student might pick it:* It shows Bailey is uncertain, which can seem similar to nervousness.  
  - *Why it’s wrong:* This moment is about planning and confusion over how to complete the dare, not about feeling socially or emotionally out of place after being caught.

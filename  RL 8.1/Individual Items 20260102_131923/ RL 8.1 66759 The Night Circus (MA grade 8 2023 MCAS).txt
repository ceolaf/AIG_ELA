1. Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that Bailey wants to return to the circus for his own reasons, not just because of Caroline’s dare?

A. “He wonders if he accepted the dare, in part, to return to the circus sooner.”*  
B. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside.”  
C. “And beyond proving himself to Caroline and her gang, beneath the curiosity, there is that need to return tugging at him.”  
D. “Bailey wonders which way he should go, and what might count as proof for his dare.”

**Correct Answer: A***

**Rationales**

- **A. “He wonders if he accepted the dare, in part, to return to the circus sooner.”***  
  - This sentence most directly supports the idea that Bailey’s desire to return to the circus is personal and not only about the dare. The phrase “in part” shows that his motivation includes his own wish to go back, not just fulfilling Caroline’s challenge.

- **B. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside.”**  
  - This shows that Bailey wants to enter the circus, but it does not clearly separate his own reasons from the dare. It could still be mainly about completing the dare, so it is weaker support than option A.

- **C. “And beyond proving himself to Caroline and her gang, beneath the curiosity, there is that need to return tugging at him.”**  
  - This sentence does show that Bailey has his own need to return, but it adds multiple layers (proving himself, curiosity, and need to return). Because it blends several motives, it is not as precise or direct as A in supporting the specific idea that he wants to return for his own reasons rather than just the dare.

- **D. “Bailey wonders which way he should go, and what might count as proof for his dare.”**  
  - This focuses on Bailey thinking about how to prove the dare. It emphasizes the dare itself, not his personal desire to return, so it does not support the given idea.

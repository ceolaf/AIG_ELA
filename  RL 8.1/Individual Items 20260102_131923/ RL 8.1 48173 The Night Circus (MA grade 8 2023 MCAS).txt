1. Which sentence from the passage best supports the inference that Bailey feels nervous and unsure about going through with the dare as he approaches the circus?

A. “He wonders if he accepted the dare, in part, to return to the circus sooner.”  

B. “It takes Bailey the better part of ten minutes to walk all the way across the field, and the closer he gets, the larger and more intimidating the tents look, and the more his conviction fades.” *  

C. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”  

D. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”  


Rationales:

- **A. “He wonders if he accepted the dare, in part, to return to the circus sooner.”**  
  This sentence explains one of Bailey’s possible motivations for accepting the dare, but it does not show that he is feeling nervous or unsure as he gets closer to the circus. It focuses on his reasons, not his hesitation.

- **B. “It takes Bailey the better part of ten minutes to walk all the way across the field, and the closer he gets, the larger and more intimidating the tents look, and the more his conviction fades.” *  
  This is the strongest evidence. The words “intimidating” and “the more his conviction fades” clearly show that as Bailey nears the circus, his confidence weakens and he becomes less sure about going through with the dare, supporting the inference that he is nervous and uncertain.

- **C. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”**  
  This suggests that Bailey genuinely wants to enter the circus and is motivated by curiosity. It shows interest and desire, not nervousness or doubt, so it does not best support the idea that he is unsure.

- **D. “Bailey looks back across the field. The others are still in the tree, though they look tiny from so far away.”**  
  This shows that Bailey is aware his friends are watching from a distance, but it does not reveal his emotional state about the dare. It neither states nor clearly implies that he feels nervous or uncertain, making it weaker evidence than option B.

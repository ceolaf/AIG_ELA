2. Which quotation from the passage best supports the inference that the circus has a mysterious, almost impossible way of traveling from place to place?

A. “None of the pathways ended, they curved into others or circled back to the courtyard.”  

B. “The tents look surprisingly old and worn in the light, and he wonders how long the circus has been traveling, and where it goes when it leaves.”  

C. “He thinks there must be a circus train, though there is not one at the nearest station, and as far as he can tell, no one ever sees such a train come or go.” *  

D. “The afternoon sun casts long shadows across the tents, stretching over the dry ground.”  


Rationales:

A. “None of the pathways ended, they curved into others or circled back to the courtyard.”  
- This suggests the circus grounds are maze-like and confusing, but it says nothing about how the circus itself travels from place to place. It does not support the inference that its movement is mysterious or impossible.

B. “The tents look surprisingly old and worn in the light, and he wonders how long the circus has been traveling, and where it goes when it leaves.”  
- This shows Bailey wondering about the circus’s history and destinations, but it does not clearly suggest anything impossible or magical about how it travels. It raises questions without giving evidence that its movement is mysterious in a supernatural way.

C. “He thinks there must be a circus train, though there is not one at the nearest station, and as far as he can tell, no one ever sees such a train come or go.” *  
- This directly supports the inference that the circus’s travel is mysterious and seemingly impossible. Bailey assumes a normal explanation (a train) but observes that no one ever sees it arrive or leave, implying that the circus moves in a way that defies ordinary explanation. This is the strongest support for the inference.

D. “The afternoon sun casts long shadows across the tents, stretching over the dry ground.”  
- This is descriptive imagery about light and shadow. It does not relate to how the circus travels or suggest anything about its mysterious arrival or departure, so it does not support the given inference.

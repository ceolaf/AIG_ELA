C. “He ached to go back almost the moment he walked away.” *  
D. “Bailey stands there for a long while before he walks back across the field.”

**Correct Answer: C***

### Rationales

**Option C (Key):**  
“He ached to go back almost the moment he walked away.”  
- The verb “ached” shows a strong, almost physical emotional longing.  
- The phrase “almost the moment he walked away” emphasizes that his desire to return is immediate and intense.  
- This sentence most directly supports the inference that Bailey feels a powerful emotional pull toward the circus even after leaving it.

**Option A (Distractor):**  
“It takes Bailey the better part of ten minutes to walk all the way across the field, and the closer he gets, the larger and more intimidating the tents look, and the more his conviction fades.”  
- This focuses on Bailey’s fading courage as he approaches the circus during the dare.  
- It shows intimidation and doubt, not a strong emotional pull to the circus after leaving it.  
- It does not support the specific inference about his lingering attachment once he is away.

**Option B (Distractor):**  
“He could not properly describe it afterward. He could only nod when his mother asked if he had enjoyed himself.”  
- This shows that Bailey is overwhelmed and somewhat speechless about his experience.  
- While it implies the circus affected him, it does not clearly show an ongoing emotional pull or longing to return.  
- It is weaker evidence for the specific inference than Option C.

**Option D (Distractor):**  
“Bailey stands there for a long while before he walks back across the field.”  
- This indicates that Bailey hesitates or lingers by the fence, which might suggest he is thinking or unsure.  
- However, it does not explicitly show that he feels a powerful emotional pull after leaving the circus grounds.  
- Without the word “ached” or a similar description, this is only indirect, less precise evidence.

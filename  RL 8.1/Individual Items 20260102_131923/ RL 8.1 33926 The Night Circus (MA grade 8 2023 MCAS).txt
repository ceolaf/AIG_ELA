**Item 2**

Which sentence from the passage best supports the inference that the circus has a powerful, lasting effect on Bailey even after he leaves it?

A. “He could not properly describe it afterward. He could only nod when his mother asked if he had enjoyed himself.”  

B. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”  

C. “Bailey wonders which way he should go, and what might count as proof for his dare.”  

*D. “He ached to go back almost the moment he walked away.”*  


**Rationales**

- **Option A:** “He could not properly describe it afterward. He could only nod when his mother asked if he had enjoyed himself.”  
  - *Why a student might pick it:* It shows that Bailey is deeply affected—so much that he can’t put the experience into words.  
  - *Why it’s wrong:* This sentence emphasizes his inability to describe the circus, not that the feeling lasts or continues to influence him after he leaves.

- **Option B:** “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”  
  - *Why a student might pick it:* It clearly shows strong curiosity and interest in the circus.  
  - *Why it’s wrong:* This sentence describes his feelings before and during entry, not the lasting effect after he leaves the circus.

- **Option C:** “Bailey wonders which way he should go, and what might count as proof for his dare.”  
  - *Why a student might pick it:* It shows that Bailey is thinking carefully about the circus and his actions.  
  - *Why it’s wrong:* This line focuses on his concern about the dare and finding proof, not on a powerful emotional impact that continues after his visit.

- **Option D (Key):** “He ached to go back almost the moment he walked away.”  
  - *Why it’s correct:* This sentence directly states that as soon as Bailey leaves, he feels an “ache” to return, showing a strong, immediate, and ongoing emotional pull. It most strongly supports the inference that the circus has a powerful, lasting effect on him even after he is no longer there.

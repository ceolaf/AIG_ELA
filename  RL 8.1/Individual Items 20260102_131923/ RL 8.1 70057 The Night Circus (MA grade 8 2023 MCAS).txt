1. Which sentence from the passage best supports the inference that Bailey’s desire to return to the circus is stronger than his fear of getting caught trespassing?

A. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”  

B. “Bailey doesn’t know what ‘exsanguinated’ means, but he doesn’t much like the sound of it.”  

*C. “And beyond proving himself to Caroline and her gang, beneath the curiosity, there is that need to return tugging at him.”*  

D. “He is already trying to come up with something he can use as proof without having to go in, when he reaches the gates.”  


Rationales:

- **Option A:** “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”  
  - *Why a student might pick it:* It shows Bailey wants to go inside and mentions his curiosity, which seems like a strong motive.  
  - *Why it’s wrong:* This sentence explains that curiosity and the dare motivate him, but it does not clearly show that his longing to return outweighs his fear of trespassing. It lacks the explicit idea of a powerful “need” that overcomes his worries about getting caught.

- **Option B:** “Bailey doesn’t know what ‘exsanguinated’ means, but he doesn’t much like the sound of it.”  
  - *Why a student might pick it:* It directly mentions his uneasiness, which relates to fear.  
  - *Why it’s wrong:* This line shows that Bailey is nervous about the threat on the sign, not that his desire to return is stronger than that fear. It highlights fear without showing that he chooses to act despite it.

- **Option C (Key):** “And beyond proving himself to Caroline and her gang, beneath the curiosity, there is that need to return tugging at him.”  
  - *Why it’s correct:* This sentence explicitly states that Bailey feels a “need to return” that is pulling at him, and it places that need “beyond” and “beneath” other motives like the dare and curiosity. That wording most strongly supports the inference that his deep desire to go back to the circus ultimately drives him more than his fear of trespassing or being caught.

- **Option D:** “He is already trying to come up with something he can use as proof without having to go in, when he reaches the gates.”  
  - *Why a student might pick it:* It shows that Bailey is worried enough to look for a way to avoid entering, which suggests fear or hesitation.  
  - *Why it’s wrong:* This sentence actually emphasizes his reluctance and attempts to avoid going in, not that his desire to return is stronger than that fear. It suggests the opposite of the inference in the question.

1. Which sentence from the passage best supports the inference that the circus feels less magical and exciting to Bailey during the daytime than it did at night?

A. “If the magic is still there in the daytime, he cannot feel it.” *  

B. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”  

C. “Even the food was amazing. Apples dipped in caramel so dark they appeared almost blackened but remained light and crisp and sweet.”  

D. “There doesn’t even appear to be anyone there, as though the whole place is deserted.”  


Rationales:

- **A. “If the magic is still there in the daytime, he cannot feel it.”*  
  This is the strongest evidence. It directly contrasts the “magic” Bailey felt before with how he feels now in the daytime, clearly supporting the idea that the circus seems less magical and exciting to him during the day.

- **B. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside. Not just because of the dare but because he is curious.”**  
  This shows Bailey’s curiosity and desire to enter the circus, but it does not compare his nighttime and daytime experiences or say anything about the magic or excitement being weaker.

- **C. “Even the food was amazing. Apples dipped in caramel so dark they appeared almost blackened but remained light and crisp and sweet.”**  
  This describes how wonderful the circus is at night, but it only supports how magical it felt then. It does not address how it feels during the day, so it cannot be the best evidence for the contrast in the question.

- **D. “There doesn’t even appear to be anyone there, as though the whole place is deserted.”**  
  This supports the idea that the circus seems empty and quiet in the daytime, which hints at a less exciting atmosphere, but it does not explicitly connect to Bailey’s sense of lost “magic” as clearly as option A.

### Rationales

- **A. “It takes Bailey the better part of ten minutes to walk all the way across the field, and the closer he gets, the larger and more intimidating the tents look, and the more his conviction fades.”***  
  - This is the strongest evidence that Bailey is nervous. The tents seem “intimidating,” and the phrase “the more his conviction fades” shows that his confidence is shrinking as he approaches, indicating growing nervousness.

- **B. “Bailey finds that he does, actually, want to go inside.”**  
  - This supports the idea that Bailey is curious and wants to enter, but it does not show that he feels nervous. It focuses on his desire, not his anxiety.

- **C. “Bailey wonders which way he should go, and what might count as proof for his dare.”**  
  - This shows that Bailey is thinking about directions and evidence for the dare. It may suggest uncertainty, but not clearly nervousness about entering the circus itself.

- **D. “Bailey turns right at the end of the passage, and finds himself in a row of tents, each with a door and a sign advertising its contents.”**  
  - This only describes Bailey’s movement and what he sees. It gives no information about his feelings, so it does not support the idea that he is nervous.

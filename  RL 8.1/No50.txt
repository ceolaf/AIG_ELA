test takers should not be asked to draw their own conclusion about what a text says explicitly or to draw any inferences from the passage, themselves. They should not be asked whether evidence exists to support a conclusion about what a text says (i.e., whether a conclusion is accurate). They should not be asked for their opinion about the meaning of the passage or any excerpt thereof.

Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

Which statement best explains a central idea of the passage and how it is developed throughout the text?

A. The passage shows how Jim Bridger’s early training as a blacksmith led directly to his later fame as a storyteller, tracing how his skills with iron tools helped him entertain travelers at Fort Bridger.  

B. The passage develops the idea that Jim Bridger was an important explorer and guide of the American West by describing his discoveries, his role in western travel routes, and the lasting honors given to his name.*  

C. The passage develops the idea that Jim Bridger often exaggerated the truth by focusing on his tall tales, showing how his stories became more unbelievable over time and eventually replaced his work as a guide.  

D. The passage explains that Jim Bridger was mainly a successful businessman by following the growth of his beaver-trapping company and showing how it expanded into a large trading network across the West.  


**Rationales**

**A.**  
- Misidentifies the central idea and mis-traces development.  
- The blacksmith apprenticeship is mentioned only briefly at the beginning, then dropped.  
- The passage does not connect metalworking skills to his storytelling; his fame as a storyteller is linked to Fort Bridger and his role on the frontier, not to blacksmithing.  
- This confuses a minor early detail with the main, recurring idea.

**B. \***  
- Correct.  
- Central idea: Jim Bridger was a significant frontiersman—an explorer, guide, and mountain man—whose actions helped shape travel and settlement in the American West and whose importance is remembered today.  
- Development across the text:  
  - Early paragraphs describe his joining an expedition on the Missouri River and being among the first European Americans to see Yellowstone.  
  - Next, the text covers his exploration of Bear River and (probable) discovery of the Great Salt Lake.  
  - It then explains his success as a trapper and part-owner of a beaver-trapping company, showing his growing role in western expansion.  
  - The building of Fort Bridger and his guiding work show him helping settlers move west and cross the Rocky Mountains.  
  - The discovery of Bridger’s Pass and its later use by the Transcontinental Railroad highlight his lasting impact on major travel routes.  
  - The conclusion states he is remembered as a “skilled mountain man and storyteller” and notes that many western places are named for him, tying his life’s actions to his enduring importance.  
- This option correctly identifies the central idea and explains how supporting details throughout the passage develop it.

**C.**  
- Overstates a secondary idea and misreads its development.  
- The tall tales are one part of his character, used to “tease new arrivals” and “amuse the locals,” but they do not “replace” his work as a guide, nor do they become the main focus of the passage.  
- The text spends more space on his explorations, guiding, and contributions to western travel than on the stories themselves.  
- This confuses an interesting supporting idea (his storytelling) with the primary central idea (his role and importance as a frontiersman).

**D.**  
- Misidentifies the central idea and misrepresents the text’s emphasis.  
- The beaver-trapping company and Fort Bridger appear, but they are part of his life as a mountain man and frontiersman, not evidence that he was “mainly a successful businessman.”  
- The passage does not “follow the growth” of a large trading network; it briefly notes his part ownership in a trapping company and mentions Fort Bridger as a stop for travelers.  
- This takes one supporting aspect of his life (trapping and trading) and incorrectly elevates it to the main idea.

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

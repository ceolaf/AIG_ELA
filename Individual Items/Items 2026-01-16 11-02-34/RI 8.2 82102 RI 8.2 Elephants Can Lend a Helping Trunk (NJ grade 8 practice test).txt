Passage: RI 8.2 Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk (NJ grade 8 practice test).txt

1. Which statement best expresses a central idea of the passage?

A. Elephants can be trained by humans to perform complex tricks for food rewards.  
B. Elephants show advanced cooperation skills that reveal high social intelligence.*  
C. Elephants in captivity behave very differently from elephants in the wild.  
D. Elephants are better at solving all problem‑solving tasks than chimpanzees.

**Rationales**

- **A. Elephants can be trained by humans to perform complex tricks for food rewards.**  
  - The passage does mention mahouts and training, but this is a supporting detail that explains how the experiment was set up, not the main focus. The central idea is about what the experiment reveals about elephants’ social cognition, not about training tricks.

- **B. Elephants show advanced cooperation skills that reveal high social intelligence.*  
  - This is correct. The introduction states that elephants “know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk” and that this is “a sign of higher social cognition.” The experiments and expert comments all support the idea that elephants can understand when a partner is needed and can wait or give up appropriately, showing advanced cooperative intelligence.

- **C. Elephants in captivity behave very differently from elephants in the wild.**  
  - The passage briefly connects lab findings to observations in nature (e.g., elephants lifting a fallen companion), but it does not argue that captive and wild elephants behave very differently. Instead, it shows consistency between lab and field behavior, so this is not the central idea.

- **D. Elephants are better at solving all problem‑solving tasks than chimpanzees.**  
  - The text notes that elephants “learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees” in one specific cooperation task, but it does not claim elephants are better at all problem‑solving tasks. That overgeneralization is not supported by the passage, so this cannot be the central idea.

Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk
by Virginia Morell 


Elephants know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk. That’s the conclusion of a new study that tested the cooperative skills of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand and showed that the pachyderms understand that they will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance. The ability to recognize that you sometimes need a little help from your friends is a sign of higher social cognition, psychologists say, and is rarely found in other species. Elephants now join an elite club of social cooperators: chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.

To test the elephants’ cooperation skills, a team of scientists modified a classic experiment first administered to chimpanzees in the 1930s, which requires two animals work together to earn a treat. If they don’t cooperate, neither gets the reward. For the elephants, the researchers used a sliding table with a single rope threaded around it. Two bowls of corn were attached to the table, but the elephants could reach them only by pulling two ends of the rope simultaneously. Working with mahout—Asian elephant trainers—trained elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, the researchers first taught individual animals to pull the rope with their trunks. The 12 elephants were then divided into six pairs, and each pair was released to walk to their waiting ropes. If one animal pulled the rope before the other, the rope would slip out, leaving the table—and treats—in place. “That taught them to pull together,” says Joshua Plotnik, a postdoc in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the lead author of the study, which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To find out if the elephants understood that they needed one another’s assistance, the researchers upped the challenge by releasing the elephants at different times. Thus, one elephant would arrive at the table before the other and would have to wait for a partner to show up before pulling the rope. “They learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” says Plotnik. “They would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting.” In another experiment, the partner’s rope was placed out of reach. “When the partner couldn’t do anything, the other one would just give up,” Plotnik says. That shows the elephants understood why the partner was needed, he adds.

“These are clever experiments,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who studies social cognition in wild elephants. The findings are consistent with observations in nature, she says. For instance, in East Africa biologists have seen elephants work together to lift a fallen companion with their tusks. “It’s particularly striking that the elephants were able to inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees do, comparative psychologist Nicola Clayton of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She and her team showed that rooks, too, could pass a similar dual-rope exam, although they failed to wait. The study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”

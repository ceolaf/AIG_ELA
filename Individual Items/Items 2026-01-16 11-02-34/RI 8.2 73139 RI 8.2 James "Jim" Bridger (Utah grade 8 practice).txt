Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

## Multiple Choice Item

**How does the passage develop the central idea that Jim Bridger's frontier experiences made him an important figure in American westward expansion?**

A. The passage first describes Bridger's basic skills training, then explains how he abandoned those skills to become an entertainer, showing that success on the frontier required adaptability rather than expertise.

B. The passage begins with Bridger's accidental discoveries, then reveals disputes about his achievements, and concludes by questioning whether his contributions were as significant as originally believed.

*C. The passage initially shows Bridger gaining practical knowledge through early expeditions, then demonstrates how he built upon these experiences to establish businesses and help others, and finally reveals how his expertise created permanent routes that benefited future generations.

D. The passage starts by emphasizing Bridger's role as an explorer, shifts focus entirely to his talent for telling tall tales, and ends by suggesting that his stories were more important than his actual frontier accomplishments.

### Rationales:

**Option A (Incorrect):** The passage does not suggest that Bridger "abandoned" his early skills. Instead, it shows how he continued to build upon and use his skills throughout his life - from blacksmithing to trapping to guiding. His storytelling was an addition to, not a replacement for, his frontier expertise.

**Option B (Incorrect):** While the passage does mention some uncertainty about whether Bridger or Etienne Provost first saw the Great Salt Lake, this is a minor detail. The passage does not "conclude by questioning" his contributions; rather, it affirms his importance through his discovery of Bridger's Pass, his guide work, and the many places named after him.

**Option C (Correct):** This accurately captures the development of the central idea:
- Early practical knowledge: Blacksmith apprenticeship, Missouri River expedition, discovering geographical features
- Building on experiences: Successful trapping business, establishing Fort Bridger as a supply post, becoming a valued guide
- Permanent contributions: Bridger's Pass saving 61 miles for settlers, the pass becoming part of the Transcontinental Railroad, places named in his honor
The progression shows how each phase of his life built upon the previous one to establish his importance in westward expansion.

**Option D (Incorrect):** The passage does not shift focus "entirely" to storytelling. While it dedicates two paragraphs to his tall tales, it then continues with substantial information about his mountain expertise, guide work, and discovery of Bridger's Pass. The passage presents his stories as one entertaining aspect of his character, not as more important than his actual accomplishments.

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

1. Which statement best explains how a central idea about Jim Bridger develops over the course of the passage?

A. At first, the passage presents Bridger mainly as a blacksmith’s apprentice, and later it shows how he abandoned those skills and became known only for his tall tales.  
B. The passage begins by introducing Bridger as an adventurous explorer and gradually shows how his exploring skills led to important roles as a trapper, guide, and founder of places that helped settlers move west.*

**Answer Key:** B*

### Rationales

**Option B (Correct):**  
- The central idea is that Jim Bridger was a significant and skilled frontiersman whose exploring abilities helped shape western expansion.  
- Early in the passage, he is introduced as part of an expedition that explores and maps the Missouri River and discovers areas like Yellowstone and the Great Salt Lake.  
- The text then shows how his exploration skills support related ideas:  
  - He becomes a successful beaver trapper and part owner of a trapping company.  
  - His success and knowledge help lead to the creation of Fort Bridger, a key stop for settlers on the Oregon Trail.  
  - His deep knowledge of the Rocky Mountains makes him a valued guide; he discovers Bridger’s Pass, which shortens trips and later becomes part of the Transcontinental Railroad.  
- These supporting details develop the central idea that his exploration and frontier skills had lasting importance for people moving west.

**Option A (Distractor):**  
- Misreads the development of the text.  
- While the passage briefly mentions his work as a blacksmith’s apprentice, this is only background and not presented as his main identity.  
- The text never says he “abandoned” those skills, nor does it claim he became known “only” for tall tales.  
- His storytelling is one supporting idea, but the passage emphasizes his broader role as a mountain man, explorer, and guide.

**Option C (Distractor):**  
- Incorrectly identifies the central idea and its development.  
- Bridger is not described as “lonely” or as someone who stayed “alone in the wilderness.”  
- The ending shows him retiring to a farm in Missouri and being remembered and honored, which contradicts the idea that he remained isolated until his death.

**Option D (Distractor):**  
- Focuses on a detail that is not central and misrepresents it.  
- The passage briefly mentions that “members of the team Bridger was with argued” about the Bear River, but this is not a major focus and is not about repeated “arguments with other trappers.”  
- The text does not state that disagreements ruined his reputation; instead, it shows that he became respected and that many places are named after him.

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

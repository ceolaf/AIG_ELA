## Multiple Choice Item

**Which statement best describes how the central idea of Jim Bridger as a pioneering explorer develops throughout the passage?**

A. The passage begins by focusing on Bridger's childhood hardships, then shifts to his success as a businessman, and finally establishes him as a legendary figure through his storytelling abilities.

B. *The passage initially presents Bridger as a young worker learning trades, then shows him becoming one of the first to explore key western landmarks, and ultimately demonstrates how his pioneering knowledge made him an essential guide for westward expansion.

C. The passage starts with Bridger's discovery of Yellowstone Park, then questions whether he was truly first to find the Great Salt Lake, and concludes by showing that his real importance was as an entertainer.

D. The passage first emphasizes Bridger's role in the fur trade, then describes his construction of Fort Bridger, and ends by explaining how the railroad replaced the need for guides like him.

### Rationales for Each Answer Option:

**Option A (Incorrect):** While the passage does mention Bridger's work as an apprentice and his storytelling, it doesn't focus on "childhood hardships" or present storytelling as the culmination of his importance. This option misrepresents the progression of ideas and overlooks his crucial role as an explorer and guide.

**Option B (Correct):** This option accurately traces the development of the central idea. The passage begins with Bridger learning practical skills as a blacksmith's apprentice, then chronicles his pioneering discoveries (Yellowstone, Great Salt Lake, Bridger's Pass), and shows how these experiences made him invaluable as a guide for settlers moving west. The supporting ideas about his fur trapping, fort building, and storytelling all reinforce his role as someone whose frontier expertise was essential to westward expansion.

**Option C (Incorrect):** This option misrepresents the passage's emphasis. While the text does mention the debate about who first discovered the Great Salt Lake, this is a minor point rather than a major development. Additionally, the passage presents his storytelling as one aspect of his fame, not his "real importance."

**Option D (Incorrect):** This option presents an inaccurate progression. The passage doesn't begin with the fur trade (that comes after his early explorations), and it doesn't suggest that the railroad replaced the need for guides. Instead, it shows how Bridger's discovered pass became part of the railroad route, demonstrating his lasting contribution.

### Final Version of Item:

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

Here is a unique multiple-choice item aligned to Common Core State Standard RI.8.2, designed for 8th-grade students based on the passage "James 'Jim' Bridger."

**Item ID:** RI.8.2-Bridger-001
**Standard:** RI.8.2 Determine a central idea of a text and analyze its development over the course of the text, including its relationship to supporting ideas; provide an objective summary of the text.

**Question:**
How does the author develop the central idea that Jim Bridger was instrumental in the exploration and settlement of the American West?

A. By contrasting the truthful accounts of his mapping expeditions with the fictional tall tales he told to travelers.
B. By arguing that his early training as a blacksmith was the single most important factor in his ability to survive in the wilderness.
C. By tracing his career evolution from a young explorer and trapper to a guide who established vital infrastructure for future travelers.*
D. By listing the various geographical locations he discovered to prove that he was the first European American to see the Pacific Ocean.

**Rationales:**

*   **Option A is incorrect.** While the text discusses both his mapping expeditions and his tall tales (paragraphs 2, 3, and 6), the author does not contrast them to develop the central idea of his importance to settlement. Instead, the author presents the storytelling as an additional aspect of his personality and fame, rather than a counterpoint to his exploration work.
*   **Option B is incorrect.** The text mentions his apprenticeship as a blacksmith in paragraph 1 to establish his background. However, the author does not develop the central idea by claiming this specific trade was the "single most important factor" in his survival. The text emphasizes his skills in trapping, mapping, and knowledge of terrain (paragraph 7) as the primary drivers of his success.
*   **Option C is correct.** The author develops the central idea by chronologically detailing Bridger's changing roles. The text moves from his early days mapping the Missouri River (paragraph 2), to his time as a trapper (paragraph 4), to his establishment of Fort Bridger for settlers (paragraph 5), and finally to his discovery of Bridger’s Pass for the railroad (paragraph 8). This progression supports the central idea that his influence grew from personal exploration to facilitating mass settlement.
*   **Option D is incorrect.** While the text lists locations he discovered (Yellowstone, Great Salt Lake), this option contains a factual error regarding the text. Paragraph 3 states that Bridger *mistook* the Great Salt Lake for the Pacific Ocean, not that he discovered the Pacific Ocean. Furthermore, listing locations alone does not capture the full development of his role in *settlement* (the railroad and fort).

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

Passage: RI 8.2 Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk (NJ grade 8 practice test).txt

Looking at this passage, I need to create a multiple choice item that tests students' ability to determine the central idea and analyze how it develops through its relationship to supporting ideas.

**Central idea of the passage:** Elephants demonstrate higher social cognition through their ability to understand when they need cooperative assistance from others.

**How this develops:** The text begins by stating the conclusion, then provides experimental evidence showing progressively more complex demonstrations of this understanding, and concludes with expert validation and comparisons to other species.

Here's my item:

**Item:**

Which statement best describes how the central idea about elephants' cooperative intelligence develops through its relationship to supporting ideas in the text?

A. The central idea that elephants possess advanced social cognition is first stated as a research conclusion, then systematically supported through descriptions of increasingly complex experimental tasks that demonstrate their understanding of cooperation, and finally validated through expert commentary comparing them to other intelligent species.

B. The central idea that elephants are smarter than chimpanzees begins with a simple comparison, expands through multiple experimental examples showing elephants' superior performance, and concludes with scientists explaining why elephants evolved better cooperation skills than other animals.

C. The central idea that scientists can test animal intelligence emerges through the historical background of the 1930s chimpanzee experiments, develops through detailed descriptions of modern testing equipment and procedures, and concludes with recommendations for future research methods.

D. The central idea that elephants help each other in nature is introduced through observations of wild elephant behavior, then questioned through laboratory experiments that show mixed results, and finally reconciled when experts explain the differences between captive and wild elephant cooperation.

**Answer Key:** A*

**Rationales:**

**A (Key):** This correctly identifies the central idea (elephants' advanced social cognition/cooperative intelligence) and accurately traces its development: (1) stated as a conclusion in paragraph 1, (2) supported through progressively complex experiments in paragraphs 2-3 (basic rope-pulling, then waiting for partners, then recognizing when partners can't help), and (3) validated by expert commentary in paragraph 4 that places elephants among elite social cooperators.

**B:** While the text does compare elephants to chimpanzees, this is not the central idea but rather a supporting detail. The text doesn't claim elephants are definitively "smarter" overall, and it doesn't explain why elephants evolved these skills. This mischaracterizes both the central idea and its development.

**C:** This mistakes the methodological framework for the central idea. While the text mentions the 1930s experiments, the focus is on what the experiments reveal about elephant cognition, not on the testing methods themselves. The text doesn't conclude with recommendations for future research.

**D:** This presents a false conflict that doesn't exist in the text. The passage actually shows consistency between laboratory findings and natural observations (paragraph 4 mentions wild elephants helping fallen companions). The text doesn't present "mixed results" or need to reconcile differences between captive and wild behaviors.

**LBIDAT Evaluation:**

- **Stem & Task:** ✓ (Appropriately targets RI.8.2 by requiring analysis of central idea development through supporting ideas)
- **Key:** ✓ (Definitively correct and directly responsive)
- **Distractors:** ✓ (Each based on plausible misreadings: B - mistaking supporting comparison for central idea; C - confusing methodology with main point; D - creating false conflict narrative)
- **Stimulus:** ✓ (Passage is grade-appropriate and necessary for the task)
- **Fairness:** ✓ (No sensitivity issues)

Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk
by Virginia Morell 


Elephants know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk. That’s the conclusion of a new study that tested the cooperative skills of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand and showed that the pachyderms understand that they will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance. The ability to recognize that you sometimes need a little help from your friends is a sign of higher social cognition, psychologists say, and is rarely found in other species. Elephants now join an elite club of social cooperators: chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.

To test the elephants’ cooperation skills, a team of scientists modified a classic experiment first administered to chimpanzees in the 1930s, which requires two animals work together to earn a treat. If they don’t cooperate, neither gets the reward. For the elephants, the researchers used a sliding table with a single rope threaded around it. Two bowls of corn were attached to the table, but the elephants could reach them only by pulling two ends of the rope simultaneously. Working with mahout—Asian elephant trainers—trained elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, the researchers first taught individual animals to pull the rope with their trunks. The 12 elephants were then divided into six pairs, and each pair was released to walk to their waiting ropes. If one animal pulled the rope before the other, the rope would slip out, leaving the table—and treats—in place. “That taught them to pull together,” says Joshua Plotnik, a postdoc in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the lead author of the study, which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To find out if the elephants understood that they needed one another’s assistance, the researchers upped the challenge by releasing the elephants at different times. Thus, one elephant would arrive at the table before the other and would have to wait for a partner to show up before pulling the rope. “They learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” says Plotnik. “They would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting.” In another experiment, the partner’s rope was placed out of reach. “When the partner couldn’t do anything, the other one would just give up,” Plotnik says. That shows the elephants understood why the partner was needed, he adds.

“These are clever experiments,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who studies social cognition in wild elephants. The findings are consistent with observations in nature, she says. For instance, in East Africa biologists have seen elephants work together to lift a fallen companion with their tusks. “It’s particularly striking that the elephants were able to inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees do, comparative psychologist Nicola Clayton of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She and her team showed that rooks, too, could pass a similar dual-rope exam, although they failed to wait. The study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”

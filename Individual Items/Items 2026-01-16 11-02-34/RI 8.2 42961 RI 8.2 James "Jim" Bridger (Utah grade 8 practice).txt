Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

Which statement best describes how the passage develops a central idea about Jim Bridger’s importance, and how supporting details build that idea over the course of the text?

A. The passage develops the idea that Jim Bridger was mainly an entertainer by starting with his early life and then focusing on how his tall tales at Fort Bridger made him famous across the country.  

B. The passage develops the idea that Jim Bridger’s mistakes limited his achievements by beginning with his error about the Great Salt Lake and then showing how he often misunderstood the western landscape.  

C. The passage develops the idea that Jim Bridger was a significant figure in the exploration and settlement of the American West by moving from his early expeditions, to his work as a trapper and guide, to the lasting impact of places and routes that bear his name.*  

D. The passage develops the idea that Jim Bridger’s main legacy was his business success by tracing how his beaver-trapping company and trading post grew into the most important commercial center in the Rocky Mountains.  


**Rationales**

**A.**  
- Misidentifies the central idea.  
- Storytelling is mentioned as one part of his life at Fort Bridger, but the passage does not show him becoming “famous across the country” mainly as an entertainer.  
- The text emphasizes exploration, guiding, and geographic impact more than entertainment, so this option overstates a secondary idea.

**B.**  
- Incorrect central idea and inaccurate reading of details.  
- The Great Salt Lake mistake is noted briefly and then corrected with new historical evidence; it is not presented as something that “limited his achievements.”  
- The rest of the passage shows his growing expertise in the western landscape (as a trapper and guide), not repeated misunderstandings.

**C. \***  
- Correct.  
- Central idea: Jim Bridger played an important role in exploring and opening the American West, and his influence continues through the places and routes named for him.  
- Development across the text:  
  - Early: His role on the Missouri River expedition and early sighting of Yellowstone establish him as an explorer.  
  - Middle: His trapping career, part ownership of a trapping company, and the creation of Fort Bridger connect him to westward movement and trade.  
  - Later: His years as a guide and the discovery of Bridger’s Pass, which shortened travel and became part of the Transcontinental Railroad, show his direct impact on migration and transportation.  
  - Conclusion: The statement that he is remembered as a skilled mountain man and that many places are named in his honor reinforces his lasting importance.  
- This answer correctly identifies the central idea and explains how supporting details build it from beginning to end.

**D.**  
- Misrepresents both focus and facts.  
- While trapping and Fort Bridger are mentioned, the text does not say they became “the most important commercial center in the Rocky Mountains.”  
- Business success is not presented as his “main legacy”; the conclusion highlights his identity as a mountain man, guide, and storyteller and the geographic honors to his name.  
- This option turns limited supporting details into an exaggerated central idea.

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

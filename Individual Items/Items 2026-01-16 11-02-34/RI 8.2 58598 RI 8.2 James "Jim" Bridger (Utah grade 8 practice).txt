Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

## Multiple Choice Item

**Which statement best describes how the central idea of Jim Bridger's role as a frontier pioneer develops throughout the passage?**

A. The passage begins by focusing on Bridger's childhood hardships, then shifts to emphasize his storytelling abilities, and finally concentrates on his retirement years to show how pioneers eventually settled down.

B. The passage initially presents Bridger as someone learning practical skills, then shows how he applied those skills to become a successful businessman, and concludes by focusing mainly on his wealth and property ownership.

*C. The passage first establishes Bridger as a young explorer making discoveries, then expands to show his business success and storytelling fame, and ultimately demonstrates how his frontier knowledge made lasting contributions to westward expansion.

D. The passage starts with Bridger's early explorations, but then narrows its focus to only his discovery of the Great Salt Lake, using this single achievement to define his entire legacy as a frontiersman.

### Rationales:

**Option A (Incorrect):** While the passage does mention storytelling and retirement, it does not focus on "childhood hardships" at the beginning. The passage actually begins with brief biographical information and quickly moves to his professional development. Additionally, the conclusion emphasizes his lasting legacy rather than just his retirement.

**Option B (Incorrect):** Although the passage does mention Bridger learning blacksmith skills and becoming a part owner of a trapping company, it does not conclude by focusing "mainly on his wealth and property ownership." The passage actually concludes with his contributions as a guide and his lasting legacy in place names.

**Option C (Correct):** This option accurately traces how the central idea develops: 
- Beginning: Establishes him as a young explorer (Missouri River expedition, Yellowstone, Great Salt Lake)
- Middle: Expands to show multiple aspects of his frontier success (trapping business, Fort Bridger, storytelling reputation)
- End: Demonstrates lasting contributions (Bridger's Pass, railroad route, guide work, place names honoring him)
This shows the progression from individual explorer to multifaceted frontier figure to someone whose knowledge created permanent benefits for westward expansion.

**Option D (Incorrect):** This misrepresents the passage's development. Rather than narrowing to focus only on the Great Salt Lake discovery, the passage actually broadens after that point to discuss his trapping business, the fort, his storytelling, his work as a guide, and his discovery of Bridger's Pass. The passage uses multiple achievements to build his legacy, not just one.

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

Passage: RI 8.2 Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk (NJ grade 8 practice test).txt

Based on the passage, here is another multiple choice item aligned to RI.8.2:

**How does the text develop its central idea that elephants possess advanced social cognition through their understanding of cooperation?**

A. The text first defines social cognition through expert quotes, then illustrates it with a single elephant experiment, and finally ranks elephants among other intelligent animals based on their performance.

B. The text opens with the researchers' hypothesis about elephant intelligence, tests it through trial and error experiments, and proves elephants can be trained to work together for rewards.

*C. The text establishes that recognizing the need for help is a rare cognitive ability, presents a series of experiments showing elephants understand the necessity of partners, and reinforces this through expert validation and examples from nature.

D. The text introduces the concept of animal cooperation, demonstrates that elephants can learn faster than chimpanzees, and concludes that elephants should be studied more extensively in the wild.

**Rationales:**

**Option A:** This distractor reverses the text's actual structure. The text doesn't begin with expert quotes defining social cognition—it starts with the study's conclusion. Expert commentary comes at the end to validate the findings. It also incorrectly suggests there's only "a single elephant experiment" when multiple experiments of increasing complexity are described.

**Option B:** This misrepresents the central idea as being about testing a "hypothesis about elephant intelligence" broadly, rather than specifically about their understanding of cooperation. It also incorrectly frames the experiments as "trial and error" and suggests the main point is that elephants "can be trained," missing the key insight that elephants naturally understand why cooperation is necessary.

**Option C (Key):** This accurately captures the text's development:
- Opening paragraph establishes the significance (rare ability showing "higher social cognition")
- Middle sections detail progressive experiments (basic cooperation → waiting for partners → recognizing when cooperation is impossible)
- Conclusion strengthens the central idea through expert validation (McComb, Clayton) and real-world examples (elephants helping fallen companions)
This shows how supporting ideas (experimental evidence, expert opinion, field observations) build and reinforce the central claim.

**Option D:** This distractor oversimplifies the central idea to just "animal cooperation" rather than the specific cognitive understanding of when cooperation is needed. While the text mentions elephants learning faster than chimpanzees, this is a supporting detail, not the main development. The conclusion about studying elephants more extensively is not present in the text.

Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk
by Virginia Morell 


Elephants know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk. That’s the conclusion of a new study that tested the cooperative skills of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand and showed that the pachyderms understand that they will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance. The ability to recognize that you sometimes need a little help from your friends is a sign of higher social cognition, psychologists say, and is rarely found in other species. Elephants now join an elite club of social cooperators: chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.

To test the elephants’ cooperation skills, a team of scientists modified a classic experiment first administered to chimpanzees in the 1930s, which requires two animals work together to earn a treat. If they don’t cooperate, neither gets the reward. For the elephants, the researchers used a sliding table with a single rope threaded around it. Two bowls of corn were attached to the table, but the elephants could reach them only by pulling two ends of the rope simultaneously. Working with mahout—Asian elephant trainers—trained elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, the researchers first taught individual animals to pull the rope with their trunks. The 12 elephants were then divided into six pairs, and each pair was released to walk to their waiting ropes. If one animal pulled the rope before the other, the rope would slip out, leaving the table—and treats—in place. “That taught them to pull together,” says Joshua Plotnik, a postdoc in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the lead author of the study, which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To find out if the elephants understood that they needed one another’s assistance, the researchers upped the challenge by releasing the elephants at different times. Thus, one elephant would arrive at the table before the other and would have to wait for a partner to show up before pulling the rope. “They learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” says Plotnik. “They would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting.” In another experiment, the partner’s rope was placed out of reach. “When the partner couldn’t do anything, the other one would just give up,” Plotnik says. That shows the elephants understood why the partner was needed, he adds.

“These are clever experiments,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who studies social cognition in wild elephants. The findings are consistent with observations in nature, she says. For instance, in East Africa biologists have seen elephants work together to lift a fallen companion with their tusks. “It’s particularly striking that the elephants were able to inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees do, comparative psychologist Nicola Clayton of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She and her team showed that rooks, too, could pass a similar dual-rope exam, although they failed to wait. The study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”

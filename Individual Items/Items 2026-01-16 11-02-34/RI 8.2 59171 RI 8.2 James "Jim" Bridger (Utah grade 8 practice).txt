Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

## Multiple Choice Item for RI.8.2

**Stem:**
Which statement best represents the central idea of this passage about Jim Bridger?

**Answer Options:**

A. Jim Bridger's tall tales and storytelling abilities made him famous among settlers traveling west on the Oregon Trail.

B. *Jim Bridger's extensive knowledge of the American frontier, gained through years of exploration and trapping, made him an invaluable guide and contributor to westward expansion.

C. Jim Bridger was the first person to discover many important landmarks in the American West, including the Great Salt Lake and Yellowstone National Park.

D. Jim Bridger's career as a beaver trapper led to his success as a businessman and the establishment of Fort Bridger in Wyoming.

**Rationales:**

**Option A (Distractor):** Students selecting this option are focusing on a supporting detail rather than the central idea. While the passage does discuss Bridger's storytelling (paragraphs 5-6), this is presented as one aspect of his life rather than the main focus. These students are confusing an interesting detail with the overall message.

**Option B (Key):** This is correct because it captures the overarching theme that runs throughout the entire passage. The text consistently emphasizes Bridger's exploration experiences (paragraphs 2-3), his trapping expertise (paragraph 4), his knowledge of terrain (paragraph 7), his role as a guide (paragraphs 7-8), and his contributions to westward expansion through Fort Bridger and Bridger's Pass. The passage shows how his accumulated frontier knowledge made him valuable to American expansion.

**Option C (Distractor):** Students choosing this option are making an inference error based on partial information. While the passage mentions Bridger saw Yellowstone and the Great Salt Lake early, it explicitly states he was "one of the first" (not the first) to see Yellowstone, and acknowledges uncertainty about whether he was first to discover the Great Salt Lake. This represents a misreading of supporting details.

**Option D (Distractor):** This option focuses too narrowly on one aspect of Bridger's life (his business ventures) without encompassing the broader central idea. While the passage mentions his trapping business and Fort Bridger, these are presented as parts of his larger story rather than the main point. Students selecting this are identifying a supporting idea rather than the central idea.

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

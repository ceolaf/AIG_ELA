**Multiple Choice Item:**

How does the central idea about elephants' ability to recognize when they need assistance develop through its relationship to supporting ideas in the passage?

A. The central idea emerges from descriptions of natural elephant behavior, then narrows to focus on specific experimental conditions that isolate cooperative abilities from other forms of intelligence.

B. The central idea is introduced through expert testimony about elephant cognition, then develops through increasingly complex experiments that reveal limitations in their understanding of teamwork.

C. *The central idea is established through systematic experimental testing that demonstrates understanding of cooperation, then broadens to connect this finding to both comparative evidence from other species and corroborating field observations.

D. The central idea begins with the rope-pulling experiment's basic results, then shifts focus to emphasize the speed of elephant learning as the primary indicator of their advanced cognitive abilities.

**Rationales:**

**Option A (Distractor):** This reverses the actual development pattern. The passage moves from controlled experiments to natural observations, not the other way around. Additionally, the passage doesn't narrow its focus but rather expands to show broader implications of the findings.

**Option B (Distractor):** This mischaracterizes the development by suggesting the experiments revealed limitations. In fact, the experiments progressively demonstrated elephants' sophisticated understanding—such as waiting for partners and recognizing when tasks were impossible. The passage also doesn't begin with expert testimony but with the study's conclusion.

**Option C (Correct Answer):** This accurately traces how the central idea develops. The passage begins by stating elephants "understand that they will fail at a task without a partner's assistance" (paragraph 1), establishes this through the rope-pulling experiments (paragraphs 2-3), then expands the significance by comparing elephants to other cognitively advanced species and citing supporting observations from wild elephant behavior (paragraph 4).

**Option D (Distractor):** This mistakes a supporting detail (learning speed) for a shift in the central idea. While the passage mentions elephants learned faster than chimpanzees, this remains a supporting point that reinforces the main idea about their cooperative intelligence, not a new focus. The central idea remains consistent throughout about understanding the need for assistance.

Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk
by Virginia Morell 


Elephants know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk. That’s the conclusion of a new study that tested the cooperative skills of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand and showed that the pachyderms understand that they will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance. The ability to recognize that you sometimes need a little help from your friends is a sign of higher social cognition, psychologists say, and is rarely found in other species. Elephants now join an elite club of social cooperators: chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.

To test the elephants’ cooperation skills, a team of scientists modified a classic experiment first administered to chimpanzees in the 1930s, which requires two animals work together to earn a treat. If they don’t cooperate, neither gets the reward. For the elephants, the researchers used a sliding table with a single rope threaded around it. Two bowls of corn were attached to the table, but the elephants could reach them only by pulling two ends of the rope simultaneously. Working with mahout—Asian elephant trainers—trained elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, the researchers first taught individual animals to pull the rope with their trunks. The 12 elephants were then divided into six pairs, and each pair was released to walk to their waiting ropes. If one animal pulled the rope before the other, the rope would slip out, leaving the table—and treats—in place. “That taught them to pull together,” says Joshua Plotnik, a postdoc in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the lead author of the study, which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To find out if the elephants understood that they needed one another’s assistance, the researchers upped the challenge by releasing the elephants at different times. Thus, one elephant would arrive at the table before the other and would have to wait for a partner to show up before pulling the rope. “They learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” says Plotnik. “They would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting.” In another experiment, the partner’s rope was placed out of reach. “When the partner couldn’t do anything, the other one would just give up,” Plotnik says. That shows the elephants understood why the partner was needed, he adds.

“These are clever experiments,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who studies social cognition in wild elephants. The findings are consistent with observations in nature, she says. For instance, in East Africa biologists have seen elephants work together to lift a fallen companion with their tusks. “It’s particularly striking that the elephants were able to inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees do, comparative psychologist Nicola Clayton of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She and her team showed that rooks, too, could pass a similar dual-rope exam, although they failed to wait. The study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”

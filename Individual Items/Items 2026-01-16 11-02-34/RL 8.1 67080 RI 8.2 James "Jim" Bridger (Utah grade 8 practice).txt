### Rationales

**Option C (Key):**  
“In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains.”  

- The idea in the question is that Bridger’s *discoveries* continued to matter long after he lived.  
- This sentence introduces a specific discovery—“a short cut through the mountains”—that the passage later explains had lasting importance: it “shortened trips by sixty-one miles” and “later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad,” which was part of the first railroad crossing the entire country.  
- Because this discovery later became part of a major railroad line, this sentence most strongly supports the idea that what Bridger discovered remained important well beyond his own time.

**Option A (Distractor):**  
“When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River.”  

- This shows that Bridger participated in exploration, but it does not show that the results of that exploration remained important long after his lifetime.  
- The focus here is on his age and role in the group, not on long-lasting impact.  
- A student might choose this if they focus on “explored and mapped” as important, but the sentence does not explicitly or implicitly connect that work to long-term significance.

---

**Option B (Distractor):**  
“Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide.”  

- This sentence shows that Bridger was respected and useful during his life.  
- It does not mention any discovery, nor does it indicate that anything he did remained important after his death.  
- A student might be misled by the word “valued,” but that value is clearly in the present time of his guiding work, not in the long-term impact of his discoveries.

---

**Option D (Distractor):**  
“Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.”  

- This sentence shows that Bridger is remembered and honored in the present.  
- However, it does not mention any specific *discovery* or explain how his discoveries themselves continued to be important; it only shows that people still recognize him.  
- A student might pick this because of the words “Today” and “in honor of,” which relate to the present, but the question is about the ongoing importance of his *discoveries*, not just his reputation.

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

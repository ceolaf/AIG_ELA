Passage: RI 8.2 Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk (NJ grade 8 practice test).txt

1. Which statement best expresses a central idea of the passage?

A. Elephants can be easily trained by humans to perform tricks for food rewards.  
*B. Elephants show advanced cooperation skills that reveal high social intelligence.*  
C. Elephants behave very differently in experiments than they do in the wild.  
D. Elephants are better at solving all problem‑solving tasks than chimpanzees and rooks.

**Correct Answer: B***

**Rationales:**

- **Option B (Correct):**  
  - The passage repeatedly emphasizes that elephants understand when they need a partner’s help and can adjust their behavior (waiting, giving up when a partner can’t help).  
  - The first paragraph states that recognizing you need help is “a sign of higher social cognition” and that elephants now join “an elite club of social cooperators.”  
  - Later, experts say the study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”  
  - These details develop the central idea that elephants have advanced cooperation skills that indicate high social intelligence.

- **Option A (Distractor):**  
  - Training is mentioned only briefly: mahouts help teach elephants to pull the rope.  
  - The focus is not on how easily elephants can be trained or on “tricks,” but on what the experiment reveals about their understanding and cooperation.  
  - This confuses a supporting detail (training for the task) with the main point (what the task shows about their cognition).

- **Option C (Distractor):**  
  - The passage notes that the findings are “consistent with observations in nature,” meaning lab results and wild behavior are similar, not “very different.”  
  - The contrast between experiment and wild behavior is not a central idea; instead, the text uses wild examples to support the main claim about elephant cognition.

- **Option D (Distractor):**  
  - The passage never claims elephants are better at all problem‑solving tasks.  
  - It says they “learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees” in this specific cooperation task, and compares them to rooks and hyenas only in terms of joining an “elite club” of cooperators.  
  - This overgeneralizes a specific result into a broad claim the text does not support.

Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk
by Virginia Morell 


Elephants know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk. That’s the conclusion of a new study that tested the cooperative skills of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand and showed that the pachyderms understand that they will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance. The ability to recognize that you sometimes need a little help from your friends is a sign of higher social cognition, psychologists say, and is rarely found in other species. Elephants now join an elite club of social cooperators: chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.

To test the elephants’ cooperation skills, a team of scientists modified a classic experiment first administered to chimpanzees in the 1930s, which requires two animals work together to earn a treat. If they don’t cooperate, neither gets the reward. For the elephants, the researchers used a sliding table with a single rope threaded around it. Two bowls of corn were attached to the table, but the elephants could reach them only by pulling two ends of the rope simultaneously. Working with mahout—Asian elephant trainers—trained elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, the researchers first taught individual animals to pull the rope with their trunks. The 12 elephants were then divided into six pairs, and each pair was released to walk to their waiting ropes. If one animal pulled the rope before the other, the rope would slip out, leaving the table—and treats—in place. “That taught them to pull together,” says Joshua Plotnik, a postdoc in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the lead author of the study, which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To find out if the elephants understood that they needed one another’s assistance, the researchers upped the challenge by releasing the elephants at different times. Thus, one elephant would arrive at the table before the other and would have to wait for a partner to show up before pulling the rope. “They learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” says Plotnik. “They would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting.” In another experiment, the partner’s rope was placed out of reach. “When the partner couldn’t do anything, the other one would just give up,” Plotnik says. That shows the elephants understood why the partner was needed, he adds.

“These are clever experiments,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who studies social cognition in wild elephants. The findings are consistent with observations in nature, she says. For instance, in East Africa biologists have seen elephants work together to lift a fallen companion with their tusks. “It’s particularly striking that the elephants were able to inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees do, comparative psychologist Nicola Clayton of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She and her team showed that rooks, too, could pass a similar dual-rope exam, although they failed to wait. The study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”

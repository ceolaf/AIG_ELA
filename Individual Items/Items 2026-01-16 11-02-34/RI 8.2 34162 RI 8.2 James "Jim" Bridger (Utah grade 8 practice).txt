Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

1. Which statement best explains a central idea of the passage and how it is developed over the course of the text?

A. Jim Bridger’s mistaken belief that the Great Salt Lake was part of the Pacific Ocean is the main focus of the passage, and most later details explain how this error affected his reputation.  
B. The passage shows how Jim Bridger’s early work as a blacksmith led directly to his later success as a trapper, and this cause-and-effect relationship is the central idea that the author develops.  
*C. The passage develops the central idea that Jim Bridger became an important and widely remembered western frontiersman by tracing his growth from young explorer and trapper to famous guide, storyteller, and namesake of places in the American West.*  
D. The author’s main focus is that tall tales were the most important part of frontier life, and the details about Bridger’s travels are included only to provide settings for his stories.

### Rationales

**Correct Answer: C**

- The first paragraph states that the passage will explain the “life and importance” of Jim Bridger.  
- The text then traces his development: early life and apprenticeship, first expeditions (Missouri River, Yellowstone, Great Salt Lake), success as a trapper and business owner, founding of Fort Bridger, fame as a storyteller, work as a mountain guide, discovery of Bridger’s Pass, and his lasting legacy in place names.  
- These details all support the central idea that Bridger became an important and remembered western frontiersman, and the passage develops this idea chronologically from youth to legacy.

**Distractor A:**

- This option incorrectly identifies Bridger’s mistake about the Great Salt Lake as the main focus.  
- The Great Salt Lake episode is only one paragraph in a much longer life story; it is mentioned, then the passage moves on to trapping, Fort Bridger, guiding, and Bridger’s Pass.  
- Later details do not describe how the mistake affected his reputation, so this does not accurately describe the central idea or its development.

**Distractor B:**

- While the passage mentions that Bridger worked as a blacksmith’s apprentice, it does not show a direct chain from blacksmithing to trapping as the main through-line of the text.  
- The central idea is not limited to that cause-and-effect relationship; instead, it covers his broader role and importance as an explorer, trapper, guide, and storyteller.  
- Many key details about guiding, the pass, and his legacy are unrelated to blacksmithing, so this cannot be the central idea.

**Distractor D:**

- Bridger’s tall tales are one important aspect of his character, but they are not presented as “the most important part of frontier life.”  
- The passage devotes multiple paragraphs to exploration, trapping, Fort Bridger, guiding, and Bridger’s Pass, which shows that his travels and practical achievements are central, not merely settings for stories.  
- This option misrepresents both the main focus and how the supporting details are used.

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

Passage: RL 8.4 Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant (MN grade 8 2018).txt

**Item ID:** RL.8.4_IdleConversation

**Standard:** CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.8.4: Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text, including figurative and connotative meanings; analyze the impact of specific word choices on meaning and tone...

**Passage:** Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant

**Item Stem:**
Read the sentence from paragraph 9.

“‘This is a hospital, not a place for **idle** conversation.’”

What does the word **idle** suggest about Dr. Blackwell’s attitude toward Diana’s behavior?

**Answer Options:**

A. She thinks Diana is avoiding her work to talk about personal matters.
B. She considers the comfort Diana provides to the patient to be unnecessary.*
C. She worries that Diana is disturbing other patients with the noise.
D. She believes Diana is behaving in a lazy manner by moving too slowly.

**Rationales:**

*   **A.** This distractor is plausible if the student interprets “idle conversation” as “gossip.” However, the context establishes that Diana is speaking “soothingly” to calm a nervous patient, not discussing personal matters.
*   **B. Correct.** The author contrasts Diana’s intent (soothing a frightened patient) with Dr. Blackwell’s descriptor (“idle”). In this context, “idle” implies that the conversation has no value or purpose. This word choice reveals that Dr. Blackwell views emotional comfort as a waste of time in a medical setting, prioritizing clinical efficiency over bedside manner.
*   **C.** This distractor is plausible if the student focuses on the command “Less chatter” and assumes the issue is the volume or disturbance. However, the use of the specific adjective “idle” critiques the *value* of the conversation, not just the noise level.
*   **D.** This distractor is plausible because the denotative meaning of “idle” is often associated with laziness or inaction. However, Diana is actively helping a patient onto a bed while talking, so the charge of “idle” refers to the words she is using, not her physical work ethic.

**LBIDAT Evaluation:**

**Stem & Task:** **✓**
The stem directs the student to a specific sentence and asks them to analyze the implications of a specific word choice within that context. This aligns directly with the "advanced skill" of recognizing how an author's use of a word shapes meaning and tone, as required by RL.8.4. The task requires reading beyond the denotative meaning of "idle" (lazy) to understand its connotative application to "comforting words" in this specific text.

**The Key:** **✓**
Option B is definitively correct based on the text. The passage sets up a contrast between the narrator's empathetic approach ("spoke soothingly") and Dr. Blackwell's pragmatic, perhaps harsh, correction. Labeling the comfort as "idle" (useless/vain) signals that Blackwell does not value that aspect of care.

**Distractors:** **✓**
*   Distractor A relies on a common association (idle talk = gossip) that contradicts the specific context (soothing talk).
*   Distractor C relies on a surface-level reading of the situation (chatter = noise) rather than the deeper meaning of the word choice.
*   Distractor D relies on the literal/denotative definition of the word "idle" (lazy) which does not fit the context of the action described.
All distractors are plausible to a student who has not mastered the standard but are definitively incorrect based on a careful reading of the text.

**Stimulus:** **✓**
The stimulus provided ("Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant") is appropriate for 8th grade and contains sufficient literary nuance (the contrast between the narrator's internal monologue and the external dialogue) to support the item. The text is error-free and clearly labeled.

**Fairness:** **✓**
The item and passage do not raise inappropriate sensitivity topics. The context of a historical medical setting and the challenges of early female doctors is educational and appropriate. The reprimand described is a common workplace/educational dynamic and does not trigger emotional distress that would impede testing.

Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant

written for the Minnesota Department of Education

Elizabeth Blackwell was the first American woman to attend medical school. In 1857, unable to find work because of her gender, Dr. Blackwell opened her own clinic in New York, where her primary patients (and employees) were women. After the Civil War ended in 1865, she opened a medical school at the clinic to train other women to become doctors. The following is a fictional personal reflection written by a nurse who hopes to achieve this goal.

I was only a few days into my second week working under Miss . . . I mean, Dr. Blackwell, and already I felt that I could do nothing right.

Actually, my first mistake was not remembering to call her by her title. The idea of a woman doctor still required some adjustment, even though I harbored the hope of becoming one myself someday.

When I first heard of Elizabeth Blackwell and her accomplishments—the first American woman to be admitted to medical school, the first to become a doctor, the first to open her own clinic—she became my heroine. I saved as much money as I could from my nursing duties. When the war finally ended, I moved to New York and became one of her apprentices. My parents disapproved, of course; they thought I should return home and find a husband among the young men who survived the war. But after what I have seen and experienced at the battlefield, I know I can do more. I know that I am no longer satisfied with bandaging wounds and comforting the afflicted. I long to save lives, find cures for diseases, make the broken whole again. And now, someone has shown the world that women are as capable of accomplishing these deeds as any man.

However, my first week under Dr. Blackwell’s tutelage has, I fear, called my abilities into question. I was quite capable in my former role as a field nurse, but now I feel very self-conscious under her watchful eye. I either freeze like a statue or make all manner of clumsy blunders. If I was hoping to find a motherly figure in Dr. Blackwell, I was quickly disabused of that notion. On my very first day, when I failed to adequately prepare a tray of instruments, she thought nothing of reprimanding me in front of all the other students, nurses, and patients. Every day has brought at least one similar scolding. It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance.

I must somehow manage to do better, make no further mistakes, and gain the doctor’s respect, or she will send me away. That would extinguish my hopes, for the Women’s Medical College that Dr. Blackwell has founded here at the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children is the only institution of its kind.

This institution is sorely needed. Many women were made widows during the war. Others saw their husbands return to them so badly injured that they cannot possibly work. These women have little money for a doctor when they or their children become ill. Established doctors expect to be paid for their services. And so these less fortunate patients come to us.

I think the relief I see in these women’s faces, however, is based on more than financial concerns. Though the clinic accepts people who cannot pay, more than one young woman has communicated to me that she is more comfortable discussing her health problems with another woman than with a man. I am still not sure our patients are as confident in our abilities as they would be with those of a male doctor. Female physicians are still more of a curiosity than anything. These patients, however, cannot afford to doubt us.

Today I spoke soothingly to a nervous young woman who was in my charge, trying to calm her as I helped her onto the bed. The poor girl looked alarmed; her eyes darted back and forth, and her fingers trembled in my hands. She had obviously never been in a medical institution before.

 “Less chatter, please, Diana!” Dr. Blackwell snapped. “This is a hospital, not a place for idle conversation.” Once again, I felt unjustly reprimanded, like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar. As usual, I bit my tongue and said nothing. My patient forgot her fear for a moment and gave me a sympathetic look. That response only made me feel worse.

An industrial accident had occurred earlier in the day, so the night was unusually busy. I did not have the chance to stop and think but simply moved purposefully from one patient to the next, diagnosing problems and administering aid. Indeed, I was reminded of my time as a nurse on the battlefield during which rest was impossible to obtain.

Finally, the endless evening was finished. Only then did I turn to see Dr. Blackwell at my elbow. She had been assisting me all along, and I had not even acknowledged her. In fact, for the first time in almost two weeks, I had forgotten all about her. Now I was sure to be sent home.

But she was smiling at me.

“Well done, Diana!” she said. “Perhaps you will become a doctor after all.”

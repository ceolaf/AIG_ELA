Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

Looking at this passage about Jim Bridger and the requirements for RI.8.2, I'll create a multiple choice item that focuses on how a central idea develops through its relationship to supporting ideas.

**Draft Item:**

How does the central idea of Jim Bridger's role as a frontier pioneer develop throughout the passage?

A. The passage begins by establishing Bridger's humble origins, then shows how his early explorations led to significant discoveries, and finally demonstrates how his accumulated knowledge made him valuable to westward expansion.

B. The passage first introduces Bridger as a blacksmith's apprentice, then focuses primarily on his entertaining storytelling abilities, and concludes by emphasizing how his tall tales made him famous throughout the American West.

C. The passage initially presents Bridger as the youngest explorer on an expedition, then describes his unsuccessful attempt to identify the Great Salt Lake, and ends by explaining how he retired early due to these failures.

D. The passage starts with Bridger's discovery of Yellowstone National Park, then details his establishment of multiple trading posts, and finishes by describing how he became wealthy from the railroad industry.

**Answer Key:** A*

**Rationales:**

**Option A (Key):** This correctly traces how the central idea of Bridger as a frontier pioneer develops. The passage begins with his humble start (blacksmith's apprentice), progresses through his various "firsts" and discoveries (Yellowstone, Great Salt Lake, successful trapping), shows how these experiences led to Fort Bridger and his role as a guide, and culminates with his discovery of Bridger's Pass that aided westward expansion. Each supporting detail builds upon the previous ones to show his increasing importance to frontier development.

**Option B:** While storytelling is mentioned in the passage, this mischaracterizes the development by making it seem like the primary focus. The storytelling is actually just one supporting detail among many, and the passage doesn't conclude by emphasizing his fame from tall tales but rather his overall contributions to westward expansion.

**Option C:** This distractor misreads both the content and the development. Bridger's identification of the Great Salt Lake (even if mistaken for the Pacific) wasn't a failure, and the passage doesn't suggest he retired early or due to failures. This reverses the actual positive development of his achievements.

**Option D:** This contains factual errors and mischaracterizes the development. The passage doesn't say Bridger discovered Yellowstone (he was one of the first to see it), doesn't mention multiple trading posts (only Fort Bridger), and doesn't say he became wealthy from the railroad. The railroad used his pass, but this wasn't presented as making him wealthy.

**Final Version:**

D. The passage starts with Bridger's discovery of Yellowstone National Park, then details his establishment of multiple trading posts, and finishes by describing how he became wealthy from the railroad industry.

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

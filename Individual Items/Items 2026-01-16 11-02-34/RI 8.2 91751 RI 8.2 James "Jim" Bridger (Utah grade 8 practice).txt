Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

## Multiple Choice Item for RI.8.2

**Question:** Which statement best describes how the central idea of Jim Bridger's significance as a frontier pioneer develops throughout the passage?

A. The passage begins by establishing Bridger as a skilled tradesman, then shifts to focus primarily on his reputation as an entertaining storyteller, ultimately concluding that his tall tales were his most lasting contribution to American culture.

B. The passage initially presents Bridger as an adventurous young explorer, develops this idea by detailing his various discoveries and business ventures, then expands it further by showing how his accumulated knowledge made him an invaluable guide who helped shape westward expansion.

C. The passage introduces Bridger as one of many frontier explorers, then narrows its focus to his discovery of the Great Salt Lake as his primary achievement, before broadening again to discuss the various geographical features named after him.

D. The passage establishes Bridger's importance through his early apprenticeship, then demonstrates how his blacksmithing skills were essential to his success in beaver trapping, trading post operations, and ultimately his work repairing wagons for settlers.

***B**

### Rationales:

**Option A (Incorrect):** While the passage does mention Bridger's blacksmith apprenticeship and his storytelling, it misrepresents the development of the central idea. The storytelling is presented as one aspect of his life, not the primary focus or his most lasting contribution. The passage actually emphasizes his role as an explorer and guide more than his tall tales.

**Option B (Correct):** This accurately traces how the central idea develops. The passage begins with Bridger as a young explorer (Missouri River expedition), then shows his progression through various frontier achievements (discovering landscapes, successful trapping, establishing Fort Bridger), and culminates in explaining how his accumulated expertise made him a valued guide who discovered Bridger's Pass—a shortcut that significantly impacted westward migration and railroad development.

**Option C (Incorrect):** This distorts the passage's structure and emphasis. While the Great Salt Lake discovery is mentioned, the passage actually notes uncertainty about whether Bridger was truly first to discover it. The central idea doesn't narrow to this single achievement but rather builds to show his broader impact on westward expansion.

**Option D (Incorrect):** This misreads the relationship between the supporting details and the central idea. The blacksmithing apprenticeship is mentioned only briefly as background, and there's no textual evidence that these skills were connected to his later successes. The passage doesn't suggest he used blacksmithing skills for wagon repairs at Fort Bridger.

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

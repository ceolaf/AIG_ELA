### Answer Key  
Correct answer: **B***

### Rationales

**A. Jim Bridger’s talent for telling tall tales made him a famous entertainer, and the passage develops this idea by focusing mainly on the details of his most unbelievable stories.**

- Why a student might choose it: The passage does describe his tall tales and calls him “famous for telling tall tales,” which can seem important and memorable.  
- Why it is incorrect:  
  - This reduces the passage to entertainment, treating the storytelling as the main focus.  
  - The text only devotes one paragraph to the content of his tales, while multiple paragraphs describe his exploring, trapping, guiding, and the significance of Fort Bridger and Bridger’s Pass.  
  - The development of the text is chronological and career‑based, not “mainly” about the details of his stories.  
  - So it mistakes a catchy, memorable idea (his tales) for the central idea.

**B. Jim Bridger’s life shows how exploration and practical skills helped shape the American West, and the passage develops this idea by tracing his growth from apprentice to explorer, trapper, guide, and community leader.*  

- Why it is correct:  
  - This option captures a broad central idea: Bridger is “remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller,” and his skills and exploration affected western travel and settlement.  
  - The passage develops this idea step by step:
    - Early skill-building: blacksmith’s apprentice (learning practical skills).  
    - Explorer: youngest member mapping the Missouri; early European American viewer of Yellowstone; exploration of Bear River and Great Salt Lake.  
    - Trapper and businessman: successful beaver trapper; part owner of a trapping company.  
    - Community role: Fort Bridger as a trading post where settlers stopped for supplies and repairs.  
    - Guide and pathfinder: knowledge of the Rockies, valued guide, discovery of Bridger’s Pass, which later becomes part of the Transcontinental Railroad.  
  - This answer accurately describes both the central idea and how it is developed “over the course of the text” through his changing roles and increasing impact on the West.

---

**C. Jim Bridger’s early mistake about the Great Salt Lake defined his career, and the passage develops this idea by showing how people continued to question his discoveries.**

- Why a student might choose it: The Great Salt Lake episode stands out because it includes a correction and mentions another possible discoverer, which might make it seem especially important.  
- Why it is incorrect:  
  - The passage presents the mistake as one incident, not as something that “defined his career.”  
  - After this, the text does not “show how people continued to question his discoveries”; instead, it moves on to his trapping success, Fort Bridger, guiding, and Bridger’s Pass.  
  - This mischaracterizes both the central idea (it narrows it too much) and the way the idea is developed (it invents a pattern of doubt that is not in the text).

---

**D. Jim Bridger’s greatest achievement was discovering Yellowstone, and the passage develops this idea by explaining how his first expedition led directly to all of his later successes.**

- Why a student might choose it: Yellowstone is an impressive landmark, and the passage notes he was “one of the first European American people to see” it; students may assume that “firsts” are the most important.  
- Why it is incorrect:  
  - The passage does not say Yellowstone was his “greatest achievement,” nor does it link that expedition directly to “all of his later successes.”  
  - Yellowstone is one early example in a list of many landscapes and accomplishments; later, the text emphasizes Fort Bridger, guiding, Bridger’s Pass, and the Transcontinental Railroad.  
  - This option both overstates the importance of one detail and misdescribes the development of ideas, claiming a direct cause‑and‑effect chain the text does not support.

================== Passage Text =================

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

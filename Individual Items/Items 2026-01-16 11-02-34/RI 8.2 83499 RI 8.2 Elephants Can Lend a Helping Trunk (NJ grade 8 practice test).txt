Passage: RI 8.2 Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk (NJ grade 8 practice test).txt

**Item ID:** RI.8.2-ElephantCooperation
**Grade:** 8
**Standard:** RI.8.2 - Determine a central idea of a text and analyze its development over the course of the text, including its relationship to supporting ideas; provide an objective summary of the text.

**Item Stem:**
The central idea of the text is that elephants possess complex social cognition that allows them to understand the mechanics of cooperation. How does the description of the “delayed release” experiment in paragraph 3 develop this central idea?

**Answer Options:**

A. It introduces a comparison between elephants and chimpanzees to suggest that elephants are the only species capable of solving complex physical problems.

B. It clarifies the distinction between learned behavior and instinct by showing that the elephants required human training to understand the rope mechanism.

C. It refines the evidence for high cognition by demonstrating that the elephants understood the specific necessity of a partner’s presence to succeed.*

D. It shifts the focus from the elephants' intelligence to their patience, suggesting that social behavior is less important than the ability to wait for a reward.

**Rationales:**

*   **Option A:** This is a distractor. While the text mentions chimpanzees and compares the two species, the text explicitly states that elephants join a "club" of social cooperators including chimps, rather than being the *only* species capable. Furthermore, the specific function of the "delayed release" experiment was to test understanding of the partner's role, not to rank species generally.
*   **Option B:** This is a distractor. While the text mentions that mahouts trained the elephants to pull the rope (paragraph 2), the "delayed release" experiment in paragraph 3 was designed to test what the elephants understood about the *partner*, not the rope mechanism itself. This option misidentifies the relationship between the supporting detail and the central idea.
*   **Option C:** **This is the correct answer.** The central idea focuses on "social cognition" (understanding *why* cooperation works). Paragraph 3 describes a specific variation of the experiment where elephants had to wait for a partner. This detail develops the central idea by ruling out simple simultaneous pulling; it proves the elephants cognitively understood that the task was impossible without the partner, thereby refining the proof of their intelligence.
*   **Option D:** This is a distractor. While the elephants did show patience ("inhibited pulling"), the author uses this detail to support the idea of cognitive understanding (knowing *why* they had to wait), not to minimize the importance of social behavior. This option creates a false dichotomy between patience and intelligence.

Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk
by Virginia Morell 


Elephants know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk. That’s the conclusion of a new study that tested the cooperative skills of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand and showed that the pachyderms understand that they will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance. The ability to recognize that you sometimes need a little help from your friends is a sign of higher social cognition, psychologists say, and is rarely found in other species. Elephants now join an elite club of social cooperators: chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.

To test the elephants’ cooperation skills, a team of scientists modified a classic experiment first administered to chimpanzees in the 1930s, which requires two animals work together to earn a treat. If they don’t cooperate, neither gets the reward. For the elephants, the researchers used a sliding table with a single rope threaded around it. Two bowls of corn were attached to the table, but the elephants could reach them only by pulling two ends of the rope simultaneously. Working with mahout—Asian elephant trainers—trained elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, the researchers first taught individual animals to pull the rope with their trunks. The 12 elephants were then divided into six pairs, and each pair was released to walk to their waiting ropes. If one animal pulled the rope before the other, the rope would slip out, leaving the table—and treats—in place. “That taught them to pull together,” says Joshua Plotnik, a postdoc in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the lead author of the study, which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To find out if the elephants understood that they needed one another’s assistance, the researchers upped the challenge by releasing the elephants at different times. Thus, one elephant would arrive at the table before the other and would have to wait for a partner to show up before pulling the rope. “They learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” says Plotnik. “They would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting.” In another experiment, the partner’s rope was placed out of reach. “When the partner couldn’t do anything, the other one would just give up,” Plotnik says. That shows the elephants understood why the partner was needed, he adds.

“These are clever experiments,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who studies social cognition in wild elephants. The findings are consistent with observations in nature, she says. For instance, in East Africa biologists have seen elephants work together to lift a fallen companion with their tusks. “It’s particularly striking that the elephants were able to inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees do, comparative psychologist Nicola Clayton of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She and her team showed that rooks, too, could pass a similar dual-rope exam, although they failed to wait. The study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”

Passage: RI 8.2 Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk (NJ grade 8 practice test).txt

Item (RI.8.2 – central idea and its development)

Which statement best describes a central idea of the passage and how it is developed?

A. The passage presents the idea that elephants are in danger of extinction and develops it by explaining how conservation centers protect them through training.  
B. The passage introduces the idea that elephants behave aggressively in groups and develops it by describing how they compete for food rewards in experiments.  
C.* The passage introduces the idea that elephants show sophisticated understanding of cooperation and develops it by explaining experimental tests and expert observations that reveal this ability.  
D. The passage presents the idea that elephants are easier to study than other animals and develops it by showing how scientists quickly complete experiments with them.

Rationales

A. The passage presents the idea that elephants are in danger of extinction and develops it by explaining how conservation centers protect them through training.  
- Misidentifies the central idea.  
- The text mentions a conservation center only as a setting for the study; it does not discuss extinction, threats, or protection plans.  
- Thus, this does not match the main focus or its development.

B. The passage introduces the idea that elephants behave aggressively in groups and develops it by describing how they compete for food rewards in experiments.  
- Contradicts the text.  
- The experiments show cooperation, not aggression or competition; elephants learn to “pull together” and to wait for partners.  
- This misreads both the central idea and the supporting details.

C.* The passage introduces the idea that elephants show sophisticated understanding of cooperation and develops it by explaining experimental tests and expert observations that reveal this ability.  
- Correct.  
- Central idea: Elephants have advanced social cognition and can understand when they need a partner’s help (stated in the opening paragraph).  
- Development:  
  • Middle paragraphs: Detailed description of the rope-pulling experiments, including waiting for partners and giving up when a partner cannot help, showing their understanding of cooperation.  
  • Final paragraph: Expert commentary and field observations (e.g., lifting a fallen companion) that support and extend the same idea.  
- This accurately captures both the idea and how it is built through evidence.

D. The passage presents the idea that elephants are easier to study than other animals and develops it by showing how scientists quickly complete experiments with them.  
- Takes a minor comparison and turns it into a central idea.  
- The text notes that elephants “learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” but that detail supports their cognitive abilities, not their ease of study.  
- The passage does not focus on comparing how “easy” different animals are to study, so this mischaracterizes the development of ideas.

Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk
by Virginia Morell 


Elephants know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk. That’s the conclusion of a new study that tested the cooperative skills of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand and showed that the pachyderms understand that they will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance. The ability to recognize that you sometimes need a little help from your friends is a sign of higher social cognition, psychologists say, and is rarely found in other species. Elephants now join an elite club of social cooperators: chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.

To test the elephants’ cooperation skills, a team of scientists modified a classic experiment first administered to chimpanzees in the 1930s, which requires two animals work together to earn a treat. If they don’t cooperate, neither gets the reward. For the elephants, the researchers used a sliding table with a single rope threaded around it. Two bowls of corn were attached to the table, but the elephants could reach them only by pulling two ends of the rope simultaneously. Working with mahout—Asian elephant trainers—trained elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, the researchers first taught individual animals to pull the rope with their trunks. The 12 elephants were then divided into six pairs, and each pair was released to walk to their waiting ropes. If one animal pulled the rope before the other, the rope would slip out, leaving the table—and treats—in place. “That taught them to pull together,” says Joshua Plotnik, a postdoc in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the lead author of the study, which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To find out if the elephants understood that they needed one another’s assistance, the researchers upped the challenge by releasing the elephants at different times. Thus, one elephant would arrive at the table before the other and would have to wait for a partner to show up before pulling the rope. “They learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” says Plotnik. “They would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting.” In another experiment, the partner’s rope was placed out of reach. “When the partner couldn’t do anything, the other one would just give up,” Plotnik says. That shows the elephants understood why the partner was needed, he adds.

“These are clever experiments,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who studies social cognition in wild elephants. The findings are consistent with observations in nature, she says. For instance, in East Africa biologists have seen elephants work together to lift a fallen companion with their tusks. “It’s particularly striking that the elephants were able to inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees do, comparative psychologist Nicola Clayton of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She and her team showed that rooks, too, could pass a similar dual-rope exam, although they failed to wait. The study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”

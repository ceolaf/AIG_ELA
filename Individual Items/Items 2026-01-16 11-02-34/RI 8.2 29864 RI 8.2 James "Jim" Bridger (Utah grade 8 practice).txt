Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

Looking at this passage about Jim Bridger and the requirements for RI.8.2, I need to create an item that examines how a central idea develops throughout the text and its relationship to supporting ideas.

Let me identify the central ideas in this passage:
- Jim Bridger was a pioneering frontiersman who made significant contributions to westward expansion
- Bridger's varied skills and knowledge made him valuable to settlers and explorers

The text develops these ideas through a chronological structure, showing how Bridger's experiences built upon each other - from blacksmith apprentice to explorer to trapper to fort owner to guide.

Here's my item:

**Which statement best describes how a central idea about Jim Bridger develops throughout the passage and relates to supporting ideas?**

A. The passage establishes Bridger as a skilled frontiersman by first describing his early training as a blacksmith, then showing how this practical foundation enabled his later success as an explorer, trapper, and guide to settlers moving west.

B. The passage presents Bridger as an important historical figure by initially focusing on his geographic discoveries, then expanding to show how his storytelling abilities made him equally valuable to the westward expansion movement.*

C. The passage develops the idea that Bridger was a versatile pioneer by chronologically presenting his various roles—from apprentice to explorer to businessman to guide—showing how each experience built his reputation and usefulness to westward expansion.

D. The passage portrays Bridger as an entertaining personality by first establishing his serious accomplishments as an explorer, then contrasting these with his reputation for telling tall tales to amuse and tease travelers.

**Rationales:**

**Option A (Distractor):** A student might select this if they overemphasize the importance of the blacksmith apprenticeship mentioned in the opening. However, the text doesn't explicitly connect his blacksmithing skills to his later successes. The passage only briefly mentions this apprenticeship and doesn't return to show how it enabled his other achievements.

**Option B (Distractor):** This option might appeal to students who notice both the geographic discoveries and storytelling elements. However, it mischaracterizes the development by suggesting these are equally important and that storytelling was as valuable as his practical contributions. The storytelling is presented as a colorful detail about his personality rather than a major contribution to westward expansion.

**Option C (Key):** This correctly identifies how the central idea develops chronologically through the text, showing Bridger's progression through various roles. Each section builds on the previous one (explorer leads to trapper, trapper leads to fort owner, knowledge from all experiences makes him a valuable guide), and the passage explicitly connects these experiences to his usefulness in westward expansion (the fort serving travelers, his knowledge making him a valued guide, Bridger's Pass shortening trips).

**Option D (Distractor):** Students might choose this if they focus heavily on the storytelling paragraph in the middle of the passage. However, this misrepresents the text's structure and emphasis. The storytelling is not contrasted with his accomplishments but rather presented as one aspect of his personality at Fort Bridger. The passage doesn't develop this as a central tension or contrast.

================== Passage Text =================

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

1. Which statement best explains a central idea of the passage and how it is developed throughout the text?

A. Jim Bridger’s talent for telling tall tales is the main focus of the passage, and each paragraph describes a different unbelievable story he invented to entertain travelers.  
B. Jim Bridger’s life shows how a skilled frontiersman could shape the exploration and settlement of the American West, and the passage develops this idea by tracing his growth from young explorer to famous guide and founder of important routes and places.*  
C. Jim Bridger’s early training as a blacksmith is the most important part of his life, and the passage shows how his metalworking skills directly caused every major success he later achieved.

**Correct Answer: B***

### Rationales

**A. Jim Bridger’s talent for telling tall tales is the main focus of the passage, and each paragraph describes a different unbelievable story he invented to entertain travelers.**

- Why a student might choose it: They notice the paragraph about tall tales and remember details like “glass mountains” and “petrified birds.”  
- Why it is incorrect: Storytelling is **a supporting idea**, not the central one. Only one main section focuses on his tales; most of the passage describes his exploration, trapping, guiding, and impact on western expansion. The passage does **not** structure “each paragraph” around a different story—this misrepresents how the idea develops.

**B. Jim Bridger’s life shows how a skilled frontiersman could shape the exploration and settlement of the American West, and the passage develops this idea by tracing his growth from young explorer to famous guide and founder of important routes and places.*  

- Why it is correct:  
  - This option accurately identifies a **central idea**: Bridger as an influential frontiersman who helped explore and open the West.  
  - It correctly describes the **development** of that idea:  
    - Early paragraphs: his youth, apprenticeship, and first expedition on the Missouri River.  
    - Middle paragraphs: his discoveries (Yellowstone, Great Salt Lake), beaver trapping success, and Fort Bridger as a stop on the Oregon Trail.  
    - Later paragraphs: his knowledge of the Rockies, his work as a guide, discovery of Bridger’s Pass (later used by the Transcontinental Railroad), and the many places named for him.  
  - The passage moves chronologically to show how his skills and experiences build over time and how his actions affected travel, trade, and settlement—matching the standard’s focus on how a central idea is developed and supported.

---

**C. Jim Bridger’s early training as a blacksmith is the most important part of his life, and the passage shows how his metalworking skills directly caused every major success he later achieved.**

- Why a student might choose it: They recall that his life story begins with his work as a blacksmith’s apprentice and may assume the first detail is the most important.  
- Why it is incorrect: The blacksmith apprenticeship is a **minor, introductory detail**. The text never shows his metalworking skills “directly caused every major success.” His success is instead tied to exploration, trapping, guiding, and geographic knowledge. This option misidentifies a **supporting detail** as the central idea and falsely claims it drives all later events.

---

**D. Jim Bridger is mostly remembered for a single mistake about the Great Salt Lake, and the passage develops this idea by returning again and again to the error and its consequences.**

- Why a student might choose it: They remember that he misjudged the Great Salt Lake as part of the Pacific Ocean and may overemphasize that moment.  
- Why it is incorrect: The misidentification of the lake is mentioned **briefly** and corrected with information about Etienne Provost. The passage does not “return again and again” to this error; instead, it moves on to Bridger’s many accomplishments. The central idea is about his **overall importance and legacy**, not one mistake.

================== Passage Text =================

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

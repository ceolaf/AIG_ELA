Passage: RI 8.2 Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk (NJ grade 8 practice test).txt

Here is a unique multiple-choice item aligned to Common Core State Standard RI.8.2, designed to meet the high-quality criteria of the LBIDAT.

**Standard:** RI.8.2 Determine a central idea of a text and analyze its development over the course of the text, including its relationship to supporting ideas; provide an objective summary of the text.

**Passage:** Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk

***

**Item Stem:**
In paragraph 3, the author describes a variation of the experiment where elephants were released at different times. How does this specific detail develop the central idea that elephants possess complex social cognition?

**Answer Options:**

A. It proves that elephants are capable of learning physical tasks significantly faster than chimpanzees or rooks.
B. It demonstrates that the elephants’ success was due to an actual understanding of their partner’s role rather than just accidental timing.*
C. It shifts the focus of the text from the intelligence of the elephants to the specific design flaws of the sliding table apparatus.
D. It suggests that while elephants can cooperate, they generally lack the patience required to solve problems without human intervention.

***

**Rationales:**

*   **Option A:** This is a distractor. While the text mentions that the elephants learned "faster than the chimpanzees," the central idea being developed is not about speed or a competition between species. The point of the delayed release was to test *understanding*, not speed.
*   **Option B:** **This is the Key.** The central idea is that elephants have "higher social cognition" (Para 1). Paragraph 3 develops this by describing a test designed to rule out rote habit. By showing the elephants waited for a partner, the author refines the central idea to prove the elephants *understood* the necessity of the partner, distinguishing true cooperation from simple learned behavior.
*   **Option C:** This is a distractor. The text describes the apparatus to explain the methodology, but the "delayed release" trial was not included to highlight design flaws. It was a deliberate challenge ("upped the challenge") to test the depth of the elephants' understanding.
*   **Option D:** This is a distractor. This option contradicts the text. The text states that the elephants "would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting," which demonstrates patience and problem-solving without human intervention, specifically contrasting them with rooks that "failed to wait."

***

**LBIDAT Analysis Self-Check:**

*   **Stem & Task (✓):** The task targets the "relationship to supporting ideas" aspect of RI.8.2. It asks the student to analyze how a specific supporting detail (the delayed release trial) functions to develop the main argument (social cognition/understanding).
*   **The Key (✓):** Option B is definitively correct. It paraphrases the text’s logic: the delay proved they "understood why the partner was needed" (Para 3).
*   **Distractors (✓):**
    *   *Option A* is plausible because the text does make comparisons to chimps and mentions speed ("learned to do this faster"), but misapplies this detail to the *purpose* of the experiment.
    *   *Option C* is plausible because the text discusses the apparatus detailedly, but it misidentifies the author's intent.
    *   *Option D* is plausible if the student confuses the results of the elephants with the results of the rooks mentioned in paragraph 4.
*   **Stimulus (✓):** The text provides sufficient evidence to answer the item without outside knowledge.
*   **Fairness (✓):** The item is free of bias and sensitivity issues.

Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk
by Virginia Morell 


Elephants know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk. That’s the conclusion of a new study that tested the cooperative skills of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand and showed that the pachyderms understand that they will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance. The ability to recognize that you sometimes need a little help from your friends is a sign of higher social cognition, psychologists say, and is rarely found in other species. Elephants now join an elite club of social cooperators: chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.

To test the elephants’ cooperation skills, a team of scientists modified a classic experiment first administered to chimpanzees in the 1930s, which requires two animals work together to earn a treat. If they don’t cooperate, neither gets the reward. For the elephants, the researchers used a sliding table with a single rope threaded around it. Two bowls of corn were attached to the table, but the elephants could reach them only by pulling two ends of the rope simultaneously. Working with mahout—Asian elephant trainers—trained elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, the researchers first taught individual animals to pull the rope with their trunks. The 12 elephants were then divided into six pairs, and each pair was released to walk to their waiting ropes. If one animal pulled the rope before the other, the rope would slip out, leaving the table—and treats—in place. “That taught them to pull together,” says Joshua Plotnik, a postdoc in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the lead author of the study, which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To find out if the elephants understood that they needed one another’s assistance, the researchers upped the challenge by releasing the elephants at different times. Thus, one elephant would arrive at the table before the other and would have to wait for a partner to show up before pulling the rope. “They learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” says Plotnik. “They would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting.” In another experiment, the partner’s rope was placed out of reach. “When the partner couldn’t do anything, the other one would just give up,” Plotnik says. That shows the elephants understood why the partner was needed, he adds.

“These are clever experiments,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who studies social cognition in wild elephants. The findings are consistent with observations in nature, she says. For instance, in East Africa biologists have seen elephants work together to lift a fallen companion with their tusks. “It’s particularly striking that the elephants were able to inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees do, comparative psychologist Nicola Clayton of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She and her team showed that rooks, too, could pass a similar dual-rope exam, although they failed to wait. The study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”

Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

I'll create a multiple choice item aligned to RI.8.2 that focuses on determining a central idea and analyzing its development through supporting ideas.

## Draft Item:

**Which statement best describes how a central idea about Jim Bridger develops throughout the passage?**

A. The passage establishes Bridger as a skilled tradesman, then shows how his blacksmithing abilities led to success in various frontier enterprises, ultimately making him wealthy enough to retire comfortably.

*B. The passage introduces Bridger as an adventurous young man, then develops this idea by showing how his explorations led to discoveries, business ventures, and a lasting legacy in the American West.

C. The passage presents Bridger primarily as an entertaining storyteller, then expands this idea by describing how his tall tales attracted settlers and helped establish important western trading routes.

D. The passage focuses on Bridger's role in discovering natural landmarks, then shifts to emphasize how these discoveries were later disputed by historians studying other explorers' claims.

## Rationales:

**Option A (Distractor):** Students might select this if they focus too heavily on the opening detail about Bridger's apprenticeship as a blacksmith. However, this early skill is mentioned only briefly and is not developed throughout the passage. The text does not connect his blacksmithing to his later successes, nor does it emphasize wealth as an outcome.

**Option B (Key):** This correctly identifies a central idea that develops throughout the passage. The text begins with Bridger as the "youngest member" of an exploration group, then systematically shows how his adventurous spirit and exploration skills led to: discovering landmarks (Great Salt Lake, Yellowstone), building a successful fur trapping business, establishing Fort Bridger, finding Bridger's Pass, and working as a guide. The passage concludes by noting his lasting legacy with "many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger."

**Option C (Distractor):** Students might choose this because storytelling is a memorable detail from the passage. However, Bridger's tall tales are confined to just two paragraphs in the middle of the passage and are not connected to the establishment of trading routes. This represents a supporting detail rather than a central idea that develops throughout.

**Option D (Distractor):** Students might select this if they misinterpret the brief mention of the dispute about who first discovered Great Salt Lake. However, this historical uncertainty is mentioned only once and is not developed further. The passage does not shift focus to disputed claims, making this an inaccurate description of how the text develops.

## LBIDAT Analysis:

**Stem & Task:** ✓ - The task appropriately asks students to identify how a central idea develops throughout the passage, directly aligned to RI.8.2.

**The Key:** ✓ - The key is definitively correct and directly responsive to the question.

**Distractors:** ✓ - Each distractor represents a plausible misreading based on different errors in identifying or tracking central ideas versus supporting details.

**Stimulus:** ✓ - The passage is grade-appropriate and necessary to answer the question.

**Fairness:** ✓ - No sensitivity issues present.

## Final Version:

================== Passage Text =================

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

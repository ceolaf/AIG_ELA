Passage: RI 8.2 Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk (NJ grade 8 practice test).txt

Item (RI.8.2 – central idea & objective summary)

Which statement provides the most accurate objective summary of the passage?

A. In a series of rope‑pulling tests in Thailand, scientists discovered that Asian elephants understand when they need a partner’s help, and experts say these cooperative abilities, seen both in experiments and in the wild, show that elephants have advanced social cognition similar to that of chimpanzees, rooks, hyenas, and humans.*  

B. Researchers at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center trained elephants to pull ropes for bowls of corn, and because the elephants worked with mahouts and learned the task quickly, the study proves that elephants are easier to train than most other animals.  

C. A classic chimpanzee experiment was repeated with elephants to see if they would pull ropes together, but the elephants usually pulled too early, so the study concludes that elephants cannot understand cooperation as well as chimpanzees or rooks.  

D. Behavioral ecologists and comparative psychologists disagree about whether elephants are truly intelligent, so the article presents several different opinions without drawing any clear conclusions about elephants’ abilities.  


Answer Key: A*


Rationales

A. *Correct*  
- Captures the central idea: elephants show advanced social cooperation and social cognition.  
- Accurately includes key developments:  
  - Rope‑pulling experiments in Thailand.  
  - Elephants understanding when they need a partner (waiting, giving up when partner’s rope is out of reach).  
  - Expert commentary confirming that these findings match observations in the wild.  
  - Comparisons placing elephants among other socially intelligent species.  
- Maintains an objective, neutral tone without opinion or extra detail.

B.  
- Focuses on training and speed of learning, which are minor supporting details, not the central idea.  
- Incorrectly claims the study “proves” elephants are easier to train than most animals; the passage never makes this claim.  
- Adds an evaluative conclusion (about ease of training) that is not supported, so it is not an objective summary.

C.  
- Misrepresents the results: the passage states elephants “learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” not that they “usually pulled too early.”  
- Incorrectly concludes elephants “cannot understand cooperation as well as chimpanzees or rooks,” contradicting the text’s positive findings and praise from experts.  
- Because it distorts key events and conclusions, it cannot be an accurate summary.

D.  
- Misstates the tone and content: the experts quoted are generally in agreement that the experiments are “clever” and that elephants show “impressive cognitive abilities.”  
- There is no debate or conflict among scientists presented, and the article does draw a clear conclusion that elephants have notable cooperative cognition.  
- Therefore, it fails to reflect the actual central idea and development of the passage.

Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk
by Virginia Morell 


Elephants know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk. That’s the conclusion of a new study that tested the cooperative skills of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand and showed that the pachyderms understand that they will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance. The ability to recognize that you sometimes need a little help from your friends is a sign of higher social cognition, psychologists say, and is rarely found in other species. Elephants now join an elite club of social cooperators: chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.

To test the elephants’ cooperation skills, a team of scientists modified a classic experiment first administered to chimpanzees in the 1930s, which requires two animals work together to earn a treat. If they don’t cooperate, neither gets the reward. For the elephants, the researchers used a sliding table with a single rope threaded around it. Two bowls of corn were attached to the table, but the elephants could reach them only by pulling two ends of the rope simultaneously. Working with mahout—Asian elephant trainers—trained elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, the researchers first taught individual animals to pull the rope with their trunks. The 12 elephants were then divided into six pairs, and each pair was released to walk to their waiting ropes. If one animal pulled the rope before the other, the rope would slip out, leaving the table—and treats—in place. “That taught them to pull together,” says Joshua Plotnik, a postdoc in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the lead author of the study, which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To find out if the elephants understood that they needed one another’s assistance, the researchers upped the challenge by releasing the elephants at different times. Thus, one elephant would arrive at the table before the other and would have to wait for a partner to show up before pulling the rope. “They learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” says Plotnik. “They would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting.” In another experiment, the partner’s rope was placed out of reach. “When the partner couldn’t do anything, the other one would just give up,” Plotnik says. That shows the elephants understood why the partner was needed, he adds.

“These are clever experiments,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who studies social cognition in wild elephants. The findings are consistent with observations in nature, she says. For instance, in East Africa biologists have seen elephants work together to lift a fallen companion with their tusks. “It’s particularly striking that the elephants were able to inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees do, comparative psychologist Nicola Clayton of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She and her team showed that rooks, too, could pass a similar dual-rope exam, although they failed to wait. The study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”

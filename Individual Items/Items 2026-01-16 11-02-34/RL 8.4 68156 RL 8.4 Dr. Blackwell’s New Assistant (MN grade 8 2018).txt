Passage: RL 8.4 Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant (MN grade 8 2018).txt

Here is a unique multiple-choice item aligned to Common Core State Standard RL.8.4, based on the passage "Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant."

**Item Stem:**
Read the sentence from paragraph 7.

“Female physicians are still more of a **curiosity** than anything.”

How does the author’s use of the word **curiosity** in this sentence impact the meaning and tone of the paragraph?

**Answer Options:**

A. It creates an optimistic tone by suggesting that the public has a strong desire to learn from female doctors.
B. It creates a mysterious tone by implying that the medical methods used by women are kept secret from the public.
C. It highlights the novelty of the situation, suggesting female doctors are viewed as oddities rather than respected professionals. *
D. It emphasizes the danger of the profession, suggesting that patients are taking a risk by visiting a clinic run by women.

**Rationales:**

*   **Option A:** This distractor appeals to students who focus on the most common denotative meaning of "curiosity" (a strong desire to know or learn something). A student might choose this if they interpret the word positively, thinking the public is eager to learn from the women. However, the context of the paragraph discusses the patients' lack of confidence and the financial necessity of using the clinic, not an intellectual eagerness.
*   **Option B:** This distractor appeals to students who interpret "curiosity" as something unknown or puzzling (a mystery). While the situation is new, the word "curiosity" in this context refers to an object of interest or a spectacle, not something hidden or secretive. The text does not support the idea that the doctors are hiding their methods.
*   **Option C:** **This is the correct answer.** The standard requires students to recognize how a word is used in a specific context to shape tone. Here, "curiosity" is used as a noun to describe the women themselves (meaning "a strange or unusual object or fact"). This usage creates a tone of dismissal or skepticism. It emphasizes that while the public notices the women, they view them as a spectacle or a "freak show" rather than as serious, capable peers to male doctors. This interpretation aligns with the surrounding text, which notes that patients are not yet "confident in our abilities."
*   **Option D:** This distractor appeals to students who pick up on the tension in the text regarding the patients' hesitation ("cannot afford to doubt us"). However, "curiosity" does not inherently imply danger or risk; it implies strangeness or novelty. This option reads too much fear into the specific word choice, whereas the text focuses more on the social awkwardness and lack of professional standing.

Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant

written for the Minnesota Department of Education

Elizabeth Blackwell was the first American woman to attend medical school. In 1857, unable to find work because of her gender, Dr. Blackwell opened her own clinic in New York, where her primary patients (and employees) were women. After the Civil War ended in 1865, she opened a medical school at the clinic to train other women to become doctors. The following is a fictional personal reflection written by a nurse who hopes to achieve this goal.

I was only a few days into my second week working under Miss . . . I mean, Dr. Blackwell, and already I felt that I could do nothing right.

Actually, my first mistake was not remembering to call her by her title. The idea of a woman doctor still required some adjustment, even though I harbored the hope of becoming one myself someday.

When I first heard of Elizabeth Blackwell and her accomplishments—the first American woman to be admitted to medical school, the first to become a doctor, the first to open her own clinic—she became my heroine. I saved as much money as I could from my nursing duties. When the war finally ended, I moved to New York and became one of her apprentices. My parents disapproved, of course; they thought I should return home and find a husband among the young men who survived the war. But after what I have seen and experienced at the battlefield, I know I can do more. I know that I am no longer satisfied with bandaging wounds and comforting the afflicted. I long to save lives, find cures for diseases, make the broken whole again. And now, someone has shown the world that women are as capable of accomplishing these deeds as any man.

However, my first week under Dr. Blackwell’s tutelage has, I fear, called my abilities into question. I was quite capable in my former role as a field nurse, but now I feel very self-conscious under her watchful eye. I either freeze like a statue or make all manner of clumsy blunders. If I was hoping to find a motherly figure in Dr. Blackwell, I was quickly disabused of that notion. On my very first day, when I failed to adequately prepare a tray of instruments, she thought nothing of reprimanding me in front of all the other students, nurses, and patients. Every day has brought at least one similar scolding. It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance.

I must somehow manage to do better, make no further mistakes, and gain the doctor’s respect, or she will send me away. That would extinguish my hopes, for the Women’s Medical College that Dr. Blackwell has founded here at the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children is the only institution of its kind.

This institution is sorely needed. Many women were made widows during the war. Others saw their husbands return to them so badly injured that they cannot possibly work. These women have little money for a doctor when they or their children become ill. Established doctors expect to be paid for their services. And so these less fortunate patients come to us.

I think the relief I see in these women’s faces, however, is based on more than financial concerns. Though the clinic accepts people who cannot pay, more than one young woman has communicated to me that she is more comfortable discussing her health problems with another woman than with a man. I am still not sure our patients are as confident in our abilities as they would be with those of a male doctor. Female physicians are still more of a curiosity than anything. These patients, however, cannot afford to doubt us.

Today I spoke soothingly to a nervous young woman who was in my charge, trying to calm her as I helped her onto the bed. The poor girl looked alarmed; her eyes darted back and forth, and her fingers trembled in my hands. She had obviously never been in a medical institution before.

 “Less chatter, please, Diana!” Dr. Blackwell snapped. “This is a hospital, not a place for idle conversation.” Once again, I felt unjustly reprimanded, like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar. As usual, I bit my tongue and said nothing. My patient forgot her fear for a moment and gave me a sympathetic look. That response only made me feel worse.

An industrial accident had occurred earlier in the day, so the night was unusually busy. I did not have the chance to stop and think but simply moved purposefully from one patient to the next, diagnosing problems and administering aid. Indeed, I was reminded of my time as a nurse on the battlefield during which rest was impossible to obtain.

Finally, the endless evening was finished. Only then did I turn to see Dr. Blackwell at my elbow. She had been assisting me all along, and I had not even acknowledged her. In fact, for the first time in almost two weeks, I had forgotten all about her. Now I was sure to be sent home.

But she was smiling at me.

“Well done, Diana!” she said. “Perhaps you will become a doctor after all.”

Passage: RL 8.4 Oh Pioneers (TN grade 8 Released 2023).txt

1. In the sentence, “Her master was sunk in despair,” what is the effect of the word “sunk” on the tone of this part of the passage?

A. It suggests that the boy is slowly getting over his sadness.  
B. It shows that the boy’s sadness is deep and overwhelming.*  
C. It hints that the boy is mostly angry rather than sad.  
D. It implies that the boy is physically stuck and cannot move.

**Correct Answer: B***

**Rationales:**

- **A. It suggests that the boy is slowly getting over his sadness.**  
  This misreads the figurative use of “sunk.” In context, “sunk in despair” does not show improvement or recovery; it shows being pulled down into strong sadness. Nothing in the passage suggests he is getting over it.

- **B. It shows that the boy’s sadness is deep and overwhelming.*  
  “Sunk” is used figuratively, not to mean literally going underwater, but to show that the boy feels pulled down and weighed down by despair. This word choice intensifies the tone of helplessness and emotional depth, making his distress seem heavy and consuming.

- **C. It hints that the boy is mostly angry rather than sad.**  
  The word “despair” clearly signals sadness and hopelessness, not anger. The figurative verb “sunk” supports a tone of deep sorrow, not anger.

- **D. It implies that the boy is physically stuck and cannot move.**  
  “Sunk” here does not describe his physical position; he is able to run to his sister a few lines later. The phrase is about his emotional state, not about being physically trapped.

2. Read this sentence from the passage:  
“His sister was a tall, strong girl, and she walked rapidly and resolutely, as if she knew exactly where she was going and what she was going to do next.”

How does the word “resolutely” affect the reader’s understanding of Alexandra’s character?

A. It makes her seem uncertain and easily distracted.  
B. It makes her seem cold and uncaring toward her brother.  
C. It emphasizes her determined and confident nature.*  
D. It suggests she is frightened by the town and wants to hide.

**Correct Answer: C***

**Rationales:**

- **A. It makes her seem uncertain and easily distracted.**  
  This is the opposite of the connotation. “Resolutely” suggests firmness and purpose, not uncertainty. The rest of the sentence (“knew exactly where she was going”) supports determination, not distraction.

- **B. It makes her seem cold and uncaring toward her brother.**  
  While she is serious, her actions—wiping his face, tying the veil around his neck, trying to solve the kitten problem—show care. “Resolutely” describes her purposeful movement, not a lack of feeling.

- **C. It emphasizes her determined and confident nature.*  
  “Resolutely” carries a connotation of firm decision and strong will. Combined with “knew exactly where she was going and what she was going to do next,” this word choice shapes a tone of strength and confidence around Alexandra’s character.

- **D. It suggests she is frightened by the town and wants to hide.**  
  Nothing in the phrase “walked…resolutely” suggests fear or a desire to hide. Instead, it shows she faces the town and its problems directly, with clear purpose.

3. In the description, “the little town of Hanover, anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland, was trying not to be blown away,” what is the impact of the word “anchored” as it is used in this sentence?

A. It literally explains how the buildings are chained to the ground.  
B. It suggests the town feels heavy and safe, protected from all danger.  
C. It figuratively shows the town’s struggle to stay in place against the harsh wind.*  
D. It hints that the town is located next to a harbor full of ships.

**Correct Answer: C***

**Rationales:**

- **A. It literally explains how the buildings are chained to the ground.**  
  “Anchored” is used figuratively here. There is no mention of actual chains or anchors; instead, the town is compared to something that needs to be held down.

- **B. It suggests the town feels heavy and safe, protected from all danger.**  
  The rest of the sentence—“trying not to be blown away”—creates a tone of vulnerability, not safety. “Anchored” here emphasizes a struggle against the wind, not complete protection.

- **C. It figuratively shows the town’s struggle to stay in place against the harsh wind.*  
  “Anchored” alludes to ships held in place by anchors. Used with “trying not to be blown away,” it creates an image of the town clinging to the land, adding a tone of effort and instability rather than calm.

- **D. It hints that the town is located next to a harbor full of ships.**  
  The passage clearly places the town on a “Nebraska tableland,” a flat inland area, not near a harbor. “Anchored” is not literal here; it is figurative, borrowing a word from another setting (ships) to deepen the description.

Excerpt from O Pioneers!

by Willa Cather

One January day, thirty years ago, the little town of Hanover, anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland, was trying not to be blown away. A mist of fine snowflakes was curling and eddying about the cluster of low drab buildings huddled on the gray prairie, under a gray sky. The dwelling- houses were set about haphazard on the tough prairie sod; some of them looked as if they had been moved in overnight, and others as if they were straying off by themselves, headed straight for the open plain. None of them had any appearance of permanence, and the howling wind blew under them as well as over them. The main street was a deeply rutted road, now frozen hard, which ran from the squat red railway station and the grain “elevator” at the north end of the town to the lumber yard and the horse pond at the south end. On either side of this road straggled two uneven rows of wooden buildings; the general merchandise stores, the two banks, the drug store, the feed store, the saloon, the post- office. The board sidewalks were gray with trampled snow, but at two o’clock in the afternoon the shopkeepers, having come back from dinner, were keeping well behind their frosty windows. The children were all in school, and there was nobody abroad in the streets but a few rough- looking countrymen in coarse overcoats, with their long caps pulled down to their noses. Some of them had brought their wives to town, and now and then a red or a plaid shawl flashed out of one store into the shelter of another. At the hitch- bars along the street a few heavy work- horses, harnessed to farm wagons, shivered under their blankets. About the station everything was quiet, for there would not be another train in until night.

On the sidewalk in front of one of the stores sat a little Swede boy, crying bitterly. He was about five years old. His black cloth coat was much too big for him and made him look like a little old man. His shrunken brown flannel dress had been washed many times and left a long stretch of stocking between the hem of his skirt and the tops of his clumsy, copper- toed shoes. His cap was pulled down over his ears; his nose and his chubby cheeks were chapped and red with cold. He cried quietly, and the few people who hurried by did not notice him. He was afraid to stop any one, afraid to go into the store and ask for help, so he sat wringing his long sleeves and looking up a telegraph pole beside him, whimpering, “My kitten, oh, my kitten! Her will fweeze!” At the top of the pole crouched a shivering gray kitten, mewing faintly and clinging desperately to the wood with her claws. The boy had been left at the store while his sister went to the doctor’s office, and in her absence a dog had chased his kitten up the pole. The little creature had never been so high before, and she was too frightened to move. Her master was sunk in despair. He was a little country boy, and this village was to him a very strange and perplexing place, where people wore fine clothes and had hard hearts. He always felt shy and awkward here, and wanted to hide behind things for fear someone might laugh at him. Just now, he was too unhappy to care who laughed. At last he seemed to see a ray of hope: his sister was coming, and he got up and ran toward her in his heavy shoes.

His sister was a tall, strong girl, and she walked rapidly and resolutely, as if she knew exactly where she was going and what she was going to do next. She wore a man’s long ulster1 (not as if it were an affliction, but as if it were very comfortable and belonged to her; carried it like a young soldier), and a round plush cap, tied down with a thick veil. She had a serious, thoughtful face, and her clear, deep blue eyes were fixed intently on the distance, without seeming to see anything, as if she were in trouble. She did not notice the little boy until he pulled her by the coat. Then she stopped short and stooped down to wipe his wet face.

“Why, Emil! I told you to stay in the store and not to come out. What is the matter with you?”

“My kitten, sister, my kitten! A man put her out, and a dog chased her up there.” His forefinger, projecting from the sleeve of his coat, pointed up to the wretched little creature on the pole.

“Oh, Emil! Didn’t I tell you she’d get us into trouble of some kind, if you brought her? What made you tease me so? But there, I ought to have known better myself.” She went to the foot of the pole and held out her arms, crying, “Kitty, kitty, kitty,” but the kitten only mewed and faintly waved its tail. Alexandra turned away decidedly. “No, she won’t come down. Somebody will have to go up after her. I saw the Linstrums’ wagon in town. I’ll go and see if I can find Carl. Maybe he can do something. Only you must stop crying, or I won’t go a step. Where’s your comforter? Did you leave it in the store? Never mind. Hold still, till I put this on you.”

She unwound the brown veil from her head and tied it about his throat.

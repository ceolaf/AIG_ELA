Passage: RI 8.2 Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk (NJ grade 8 practice test).txt

Here is a second, unique multiple-choice item aligned to Common Core State Standard RI.8.2, based on the passage "Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk."

**Item Stem:**

Which statement best analyzes how the author develops the central idea that elephants are intelligent social cooperators?

A. By arguing that elephants are unique among animals because they can be trained by mahouts to perform complex tricks.

B. By starting with a general claim about elephant intelligence and substantiating it with results from a controlled experiment and real-world observations.*

C. By explaining the historical evolution of animal intelligence testing from the 1930s to the present day to show how modern science has advanced.

D. By contrasting the helpful nature of Asian elephants with the more aggressive behavior of African elephants described by biologists.

***

**Rationales:**

*   **A. By arguing that elephants are unique among animals because they can be trained by mahouts to perform complex tricks.**
    *   *Rationale:* This is a distractor. While the text mentions mahouts and training, the central idea focuses on the elephants' *social cognition* and ability to understand cooperation, not merely their ability to learn tricks. The author explicitly distinguishes between rote training and the understanding demonstrated in the "delayed release" tasks.

*   **B. By starting with a general claim about elephant intelligence and substantiating it with results from a controlled experiment and real-world observations.**
    *   *Rationale:* **This is the correct answer.** The item asks for an analysis of the development of the central idea. The text begins by stating elephants have "higher social cognition." It develops this by detailing the rope-pulling experiment (controlled evidence) and concludes by quoting experts like Karen McComb who connect these findings to wild behaviors, such as lifting fallen companions (real-world observations). This option correctly identifies the structural arc used to support the main argument.

*   **C. By explaining the historical evolution of animal intelligence testing from the 1930s to the present day to show how modern science has advanced.**
    *   *Rationale:* This is a distractor. The text references the 1930s chimpanzee experiment to explain the origin of the methodology used. However, the development of the text focuses on the *results* regarding elephants, not the history of the testing methods themselves. This is a supporting detail, not the primary method of developing the central idea.

*   **D. By contrasting the helpful nature of Asian elephants with the more aggressive behavior of African elephants described by biologists.**
    *   *Rationale:* This is a distractor based on a misinterpretation of the text. The text mentions observations of elephants in East Africa (African elephants) helping fallen companions to *support* the findings about Asian elephants. It draws a parallel between the two groups to validate the idea of cooperation; it does not contrast them or suggest one is aggressive.

Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk
by Virginia Morell 


Elephants know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk. That’s the conclusion of a new study that tested the cooperative skills of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand and showed that the pachyderms understand that they will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance. The ability to recognize that you sometimes need a little help from your friends is a sign of higher social cognition, psychologists say, and is rarely found in other species. Elephants now join an elite club of social cooperators: chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.

To test the elephants’ cooperation skills, a team of scientists modified a classic experiment first administered to chimpanzees in the 1930s, which requires two animals work together to earn a treat. If they don’t cooperate, neither gets the reward. For the elephants, the researchers used a sliding table with a single rope threaded around it. Two bowls of corn were attached to the table, but the elephants could reach them only by pulling two ends of the rope simultaneously. Working with mahout—Asian elephant trainers—trained elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, the researchers first taught individual animals to pull the rope with their trunks. The 12 elephants were then divided into six pairs, and each pair was released to walk to their waiting ropes. If one animal pulled the rope before the other, the rope would slip out, leaving the table—and treats—in place. “That taught them to pull together,” says Joshua Plotnik, a postdoc in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the lead author of the study, which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To find out if the elephants understood that they needed one another’s assistance, the researchers upped the challenge by releasing the elephants at different times. Thus, one elephant would arrive at the table before the other and would have to wait for a partner to show up before pulling the rope. “They learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” says Plotnik. “They would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting.” In another experiment, the partner’s rope was placed out of reach. “When the partner couldn’t do anything, the other one would just give up,” Plotnik says. That shows the elephants understood why the partner was needed, he adds.

“These are clever experiments,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who studies social cognition in wild elephants. The findings are consistent with observations in nature, she says. For instance, in East Africa biologists have seen elephants work together to lift a fallen companion with their tusks. “It’s particularly striking that the elephants were able to inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees do, comparative psychologist Nicola Clayton of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She and her team showed that rooks, too, could pass a similar dual-rope exam, although they failed to wait. The study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”

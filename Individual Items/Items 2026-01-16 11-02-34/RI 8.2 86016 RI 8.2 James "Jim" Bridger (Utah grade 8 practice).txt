Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

## Multiple Choice Item for RI.8.2

**Stem:**
Which summary best captures how the passage develops its central idea about Jim Bridger?

**Answer Options:**

A. The passage begins with Bridger's early life, describes his discovery of major landmarks like the Great Salt Lake and Yellowstone, explains how he became wealthy through beaver trapping, and concludes with his retirement to Missouri.

B. The passage traces Bridger's life chronologically, showing how his early work as a blacksmith led to his career as an explorer, then describing his various adventures and tall tales before explaining his death in 1881.

C. *The passage follows Bridger's progression from a young explorer to an experienced frontiersman, demonstrating how each phase of his life—from early expeditions to trapping to guiding—built his expertise and contributed to American westward expansion.

D. The passage focuses on Bridger's role in establishing Fort Bridger as a crucial stop on the Oregon Trail, then explains how his storytelling and knowledge of shortcuts made him famous throughout the American West.

**Rationales:**

**Option A (Distractor):** Students selecting this option are including inaccurate information and missing key developmental points. The passage doesn't emphasize Bridger becoming wealthy, and this summary omits his important role as a guide and his discovery of Bridger's Pass. These students are creating a summary with factual errors and incomplete coverage of the text's development.

**Option B (Distractor):** This option contains a factual error (Bridger wasn't a blacksmith; he was a blacksmith's apprentice) and oversimplifies the passage's structure. While it mentions chronology, it fails to show how the central idea develops through Bridger's increasing expertise and contributions. Students choosing this are focusing on biographical sequence rather than idea development.

**Option C (Key):** This correctly identifies how the passage develops its central idea by showing Bridger's evolution from novice to expert. The summary accurately captures the progression: early exploration experiences (paragraphs 2-3) → trapping expertise (paragraph 4) → establishing Fort Bridger (paragraph 5) → becoming a valued guide (paragraphs 7-8) → discovering Bridger's Pass (paragraph 8). Each phase builds upon the previous one to develop the central idea of his invaluable frontier knowledge.

**Option D (Distractor):** Students selecting this option are overemphasizing middle portions of the passage while neglecting the beginning and end. This summary starts with Fort Bridger (paragraph 5) rather than his early experiences, missing how the passage builds up to his later accomplishments. It represents a failure to track the full development of the central idea from beginning to end.

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

2. Which choice states a central idea of the passage and best explains how the author develops that idea?

A. Jim Bridger’s mistaken belief that the Great Salt Lake was part of the Pacific Ocean shows how little explorers knew, and the passage follows this error through the rest of his life.  
B. Jim Bridger’s life shows how frontiersmen could rise from ordinary beginnings to lasting fame, and the passage builds this idea by tracing his growth from apprentice to explorer, guide, and honored historical figure.*  
C. Jim Bridger’s trapping business was the main reason settlers moved west, and the passage emphasizes how beaver pelts led directly to the building of towns and railroads.  
D. Jim Bridger’s tall tales were more important than his real accomplishments, and the passage shows that people remember him mostly for his funny stories rather than his work in the Rocky Mountains.

**Correct Answer: B***

### Rationales

**A. Jim Bridger’s mistaken belief that the Great Salt Lake was part of the Pacific Ocean shows how little explorers knew, and the passage follows this error through the rest of his life.**

- The Great Salt Lake mistake is mentioned only once, as one episode in his early explorations.  
- The passage does not “follow this error through the rest of his life”; it moves on to trapping, Fort Bridger, guiding, and Bridger’s Pass.  
- This option inaccurately presents a single anecdote as the organizing idea of the text, so it does not match how the central idea is developed.

**B. Jim Bridger’s life shows how frontiersmen could rise from ordinary beginnings to lasting fame, and the passage builds this idea by tracing his growth from apprentice to explorer, guide, and honored historical figure.*  

- The passage begins with his modest start: born in Virginia, raised near St. Louis, and working as a “blacksmith’s apprentice.”  
- It then shows his rise: joining an expedition on the Missouri, being among the first European Americans to see Yellowstone, exploring the Bear River and Great Salt Lake, and becoming a skilled trapper and part owner of a trapping company.  
- The text further develops his importance as he helps establish Fort Bridger, guides settlers through the Rocky Mountains, and discovers Bridger’s Pass that later ties into the Transcontinental Railroad.  
- The conclusion reinforces his lasting fame: he is “remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller,” and “many places in the American West” are named for him.  
- This answer correctly identifies a broad central idea and accurately describes how the sequence of biographical details develops it.

**C. Jim Bridger’s trapping business was the main reason settlers moved west, and the passage emphasizes how beaver pelts led directly to the building of towns and railroads.**

- The passage does discuss his success trapping beavers and part ownership of a trapping company, but it does not say or suggest that this was “the main reason settlers moved west.”  
- Beaver pelts are presented as a source of income and a step in his career, not as the driving force behind westward migration.  
- The later sections connect settlers and railroads more to Fort Bridger and Bridger’s Pass, not to the trapping business itself.

**D. Jim Bridger’s tall tales were more important than his real accomplishments, and the passage shows that people remember him mostly for his funny stories rather than his work in the Rocky Mountains.**

- The passage devotes one paragraph to his tall tales, describing them as entertaining and used to tease newcomers.  
- However, most of the text focuses on his real achievements: exploration, trapping, founding Fort Bridger, guiding, and discovering Bridger’s Pass.  
- The final paragraph pairs “skilled mountain man and storyteller,” not ranking one above the other, and notes that many places are named in his honor, which reflects his broader historical significance, not just his humor.

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

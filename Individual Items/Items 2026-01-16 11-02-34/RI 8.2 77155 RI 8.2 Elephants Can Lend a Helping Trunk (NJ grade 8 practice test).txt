Passage: RI 8.2 Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk (NJ grade 8 practice test).txt

Based on the passage "Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk," here is a multiple choice item aligned to RI.8.2:

**Item:**

Which statement best expresses the central idea of the passage?

A. Elephants have been trained by mahouts in Thailand to perform complex tricks using ropes and tables to earn corn treats.

B. *Elephants demonstrate advanced social cognition by understanding when they need cooperative assistance to complete tasks.

C. Scientists have discovered that elephants are more intelligent than chimpanzees, hyenas, and rooks in solving problems.

D. Researchers at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center study how elephants use their trunks to help fallen companions.

**Rationales:**

**Option A:** This distractor focuses too narrowly on the training aspect and the specific experimental setup (ropes, tables, corn treats). While these details are mentioned in the passage, they are supporting details about the methodology rather than the central idea. A student selecting this might be confusing experimental procedures with the main point.

**Option B (Correct Answer):** This correctly identifies the central idea that runs throughout the passage. The text begins by stating elephants "understand that they will fail at a task without a partner's assistance" and that this ability is "a sign of higher social cognition." The entire passage then develops this idea through descriptions of experiments that demonstrate elephants' cooperative abilities and understanding of when help is needed.

**Option C:** This distractor misrepresents the passage's comparison between species. While the passage mentions that elephants learned faster than chimpanzees in one specific aspect and joins them in an "elite club," it doesn't claim elephants are more intelligent overall. Students choosing this may have misinterpreted the comparative statements in the passage.

**Option D:** This distractor pulls from a supporting detail mentioned briefly near the end of the passage about elephants helping fallen companions in the wild. While this example supports the central idea, it is not itself the main focus of the text. Students selecting this might be drawn to an interesting detail rather than identifying the overarching theme.

Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk
by Virginia Morell 


Elephants know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk. That’s the conclusion of a new study that tested the cooperative skills of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand and showed that the pachyderms understand that they will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance. The ability to recognize that you sometimes need a little help from your friends is a sign of higher social cognition, psychologists say, and is rarely found in other species. Elephants now join an elite club of social cooperators: chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.

To test the elephants’ cooperation skills, a team of scientists modified a classic experiment first administered to chimpanzees in the 1930s, which requires two animals work together to earn a treat. If they don’t cooperate, neither gets the reward. For the elephants, the researchers used a sliding table with a single rope threaded around it. Two bowls of corn were attached to the table, but the elephants could reach them only by pulling two ends of the rope simultaneously. Working with mahout—Asian elephant trainers—trained elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, the researchers first taught individual animals to pull the rope with their trunks. The 12 elephants were then divided into six pairs, and each pair was released to walk to their waiting ropes. If one animal pulled the rope before the other, the rope would slip out, leaving the table—and treats—in place. “That taught them to pull together,” says Joshua Plotnik, a postdoc in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the lead author of the study, which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To find out if the elephants understood that they needed one another’s assistance, the researchers upped the challenge by releasing the elephants at different times. Thus, one elephant would arrive at the table before the other and would have to wait for a partner to show up before pulling the rope. “They learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” says Plotnik. “They would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting.” In another experiment, the partner’s rope was placed out of reach. “When the partner couldn’t do anything, the other one would just give up,” Plotnik says. That shows the elephants understood why the partner was needed, he adds.

“These are clever experiments,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who studies social cognition in wild elephants. The findings are consistent with observations in nature, she says. For instance, in East Africa biologists have seen elephants work together to lift a fallen companion with their tusks. “It’s particularly striking that the elephants were able to inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees do, comparative psychologist Nicola Clayton of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She and her team showed that rooks, too, could pass a similar dual-rope exam, although they failed to wait. The study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”

Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

**Item ID:** RI.8.2-Bridger-001
**Grade:** 8
**Standard:** RI.8.2 - Determine a central idea of a text and analyze its development over the course of the text, including its relationship to supporting ideas; provide an objective summary of the text.

**Item Stem:**
How does the author develop the central idea that Jim Bridger played a vital role in the expansion and development of the American West?

**Answer Options:**

A. By focusing on the “tall tales” Bridger told at his trading post to show that his primary contribution to the frontier was providing entertainment for weary travelers.
B. By describing Bridger’s potential discovery of the Great Salt Lake to prove that he was the first European American to witness the major natural landmarks of the region.
C. *By connecting Bridger’s accumulated knowledge of the Rocky Mountains to his discovery of a pass that later facilitated the route of the Transcontinental Railroad.
D. By explaining Bridger’s background as a blacksmith’s apprentice to demonstrate that his technical skills were ultimately more valuable to settlers than his knowledge of the terrain.

**Rationales:**

*   **Option A is incorrect.** This option mistakes a catchy, interesting supporting idea for the central idea. While the text devotes two paragraphs to Bridger’s storytelling (Paragraphs 5 and 6), the text explicitly states he is remembered as a "skilled mountain man" and details his work exploring, trapping, and guiding. The storytelling is a supporting detail regarding his personality and the culture of Fort Bridger, but analyzing the text reveals that his *vital* role in Western expansion was physical and geographical, not merely entertainment-based.

*   **Option B is incorrect.** This option cites a relationship between ideas that is not supported by the text. While the text mentions his discovery of the Great Salt Lake, it explicitly clarifies that "some now think that Etienne Provost... may have seen it first." Therefore, the author is not using this incident to *prove* he was the first to see these landmarks; rather, the author uses it to show his active role in early exploration despite the historical debate.

*   **Option C is correct.** This option correctly analyzes how the central idea is developed through specific supporting details. The text builds the case that Bridger spent years learning the terrain (Paragraph 7), which directly allowed him to find "Bridger's Pass" (Paragraph 8). The author then connects this discovery to a major historical development: the shortening of settler journeys and the path of the Transcontinental Railroad. This lays out the relationship between Bridger's specific skill set and the macro-concept of Western expansion.

*   **Option D is incorrect.** This option is based on a misreading of the relationship between ideas. While the text mentions his blacksmithing apprenticeship in Paragraph 1 to show his early work ethic and skills, the development of the text emphasizes his role as a guide and trapper ("Because of his knowledge and skills [in the mountains], he became a valued guide"). The text does not suggest technical blacksmithing skills were *more* valuable than his terrain knowledge; in fact, the text implies his terrain knowledge was his most significant asset.

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

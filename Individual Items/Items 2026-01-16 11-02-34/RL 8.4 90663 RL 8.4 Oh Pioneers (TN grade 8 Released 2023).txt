Passage: RL 8.4 Oh Pioneers (TN grade 8 Released 2023).txt

Here is a unique multiple-choice item based on the passage from *O Pioneers!*, aligned to CCSS RL.8.4.

**Item ID:** RL8.4-OPioneers-02
**Grade:** 8
**Standard:** CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.8.4

**Item Stem:**
Read the sentence from the passage.

“She wore a man’s long ulster (not as if it were an affliction, but as if it were very comfortable and belonged to her; carried it like a young soldier), and a round plush cap, tied down with a thick veil.”

What is the impact of the author’s use of the phrase **carried it like a young soldier**?

A. It suggests that she feels weighed down and exhausted by the heavy coat.
B. It implies that she is aggressive and looking for a conflict with the townspeople.
*C. It characterizes her as resilient and purposeful despite the difficult conditions.
D. It indicates that she is immature and pretending to be someone she is not.

**Rationales:**

*   **A. Incorrect.** This option suggests the coat is a burden. However, the text explicitly states she wore it "not as if it were an affliction" (a burden of pain or distress) but as if it were "comfortable." This distractor appeals to students who miss the negation in the parenthetical phrase.
*   **B. Incorrect.** While a "soldier" is associated with fighting, the context of the passage describes her walking "resolutely" and having a "serious, thoughtful face" while ignoring others, rather than seeking out conflict. This distractor relies on a negative connotation of "soldier" that does not fit the characterization in the text.
*   **C. Correct.** The simile compares the girl to a "young soldier" to emphasize her strength, discipline, and determination. The text supports this by describing her as a "strong girl" who walks "resolutely," suggesting she faces the harsh winter environment with a sense of duty and capability, much like a soldier on a mission.
*   **D. Incorrect.** This distractor focuses on the word "young" and the fact that she is wearing men's clothing ("man's long ulster") to suggest she is playing dress-up or make-believe. However, the text describes her as "strong," "serious," and "thoughtful," which contradicts the idea of childish play.

***

**LBIDAT Evaluation**

**Stem & Task: ✓**
*   **No Critical Issues.** The task asks the student to analyze the impact of a specific figurative phrase (simile) on the characterization/meaning of the text. This aligns directly with RL.8.4 (analyze the impact of specific word choices on meaning and tone).

**The Key: ✓**
*   **No Critical Issues.** The key is definitively correct based on the text. The surrounding context ("strong girl," "resolutely," "knew exactly where she was going") supports the interpretation of resilience and purpose.

**Distractors: ✓**
*   **No Critical Issues.**
    *   Distractor A is a "Opposite" error; the text says "not... an affliction," but students who skim may miss the "not."
    *   Distractor B is a "Misapplied Connotation" error; soldiers fight, but the context here is about walking through a storm, not fighting people.
    *   Distractor C is the key.
    *   Distractor D is a "Misinterpretation of Context" error; it uses the "young" element of the simile but misinterprets the tone as playful rather than serious.

**Stimulus: ✓**
*   **No Critical Issues.** The stimulus provides ample context to determine the meaning of the phrase. The description of the character's movement and demeanor immediately precedes and follows the target sentence.

**Fairness: ✓**
*   **No Critical Issues.** The mention of a "soldier" is used metaphorically to describe a girl's demeanor. It does not depict graphic war violence or advocate for militarism in a way that would trigger a fairness rejection. It is a standard literary device.

Excerpt from O Pioneers!

by Willa Cather

One January day, thirty years ago, the little town of Hanover, anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland, was trying not to be blown away. A mist of fine snowflakes was curling and eddying about the cluster of low drab buildings huddled on the gray prairie, under a gray sky. The dwelling- houses were set about haphazard on the tough prairie sod; some of them looked as if they had been moved in overnight, and others as if they were straying off by themselves, headed straight for the open plain. None of them had any appearance of permanence, and the howling wind blew under them as well as over them. The main street was a deeply rutted road, now frozen hard, which ran from the squat red railway station and the grain “elevator” at the north end of the town to the lumber yard and the horse pond at the south end. On either side of this road straggled two uneven rows of wooden buildings; the general merchandise stores, the two banks, the drug store, the feed store, the saloon, the post- office. The board sidewalks were gray with trampled snow, but at two o’clock in the afternoon the shopkeepers, having come back from dinner, were keeping well behind their frosty windows. The children were all in school, and there was nobody abroad in the streets but a few rough- looking countrymen in coarse overcoats, with their long caps pulled down to their noses. Some of them had brought their wives to town, and now and then a red or a plaid shawl flashed out of one store into the shelter of another. At the hitch- bars along the street a few heavy work- horses, harnessed to farm wagons, shivered under their blankets. About the station everything was quiet, for there would not be another train in until night.

On the sidewalk in front of one of the stores sat a little Swede boy, crying bitterly. He was about five years old. His black cloth coat was much too big for him and made him look like a little old man. His shrunken brown flannel dress had been washed many times and left a long stretch of stocking between the hem of his skirt and the tops of his clumsy, copper- toed shoes. His cap was pulled down over his ears; his nose and his chubby cheeks were chapped and red with cold. He cried quietly, and the few people who hurried by did not notice him. He was afraid to stop any one, afraid to go into the store and ask for help, so he sat wringing his long sleeves and looking up a telegraph pole beside him, whimpering, “My kitten, oh, my kitten! Her will fweeze!” At the top of the pole crouched a shivering gray kitten, mewing faintly and clinging desperately to the wood with her claws. The boy had been left at the store while his sister went to the doctor’s office, and in her absence a dog had chased his kitten up the pole. The little creature had never been so high before, and she was too frightened to move. Her master was sunk in despair. He was a little country boy, and this village was to him a very strange and perplexing place, where people wore fine clothes and had hard hearts. He always felt shy and awkward here, and wanted to hide behind things for fear someone might laugh at him. Just now, he was too unhappy to care who laughed. At last he seemed to see a ray of hope: his sister was coming, and he got up and ran toward her in his heavy shoes.

His sister was a tall, strong girl, and she walked rapidly and resolutely, as if she knew exactly where she was going and what she was going to do next. She wore a man’s long ulster1 (not as if it were an affliction, but as if it were very comfortable and belonged to her; carried it like a young soldier), and a round plush cap, tied down with a thick veil. She had a serious, thoughtful face, and her clear, deep blue eyes were fixed intently on the distance, without seeming to see anything, as if she were in trouble. She did not notice the little boy until he pulled her by the coat. Then she stopped short and stooped down to wipe his wet face.

“Why, Emil! I told you to stay in the store and not to come out. What is the matter with you?”

“My kitten, sister, my kitten! A man put her out, and a dog chased her up there.” His forefinger, projecting from the sleeve of his coat, pointed up to the wretched little creature on the pole.

“Oh, Emil! Didn’t I tell you she’d get us into trouble of some kind, if you brought her? What made you tease me so? But there, I ought to have known better myself.” She went to the foot of the pole and held out her arms, crying, “Kitty, kitty, kitty,” but the kitten only mewed and faintly waved its tail. Alexandra turned away decidedly. “No, she won’t come down. Somebody will have to go up after her. I saw the Linstrums’ wagon in town. I’ll go and see if I can find Carl. Maybe he can do something. Only you must stop crying, or I won’t go a step. Where’s your comforter? Did you leave it in the store? Never mind. Hold still, till I put this on you.”

She unwound the brown veil from her head and tied it about his throat.

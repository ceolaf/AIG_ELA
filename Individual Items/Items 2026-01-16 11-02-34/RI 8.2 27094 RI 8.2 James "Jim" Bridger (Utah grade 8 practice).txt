Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

Here is a unique multiple-choice item aligned to Common Core State Standard RI.8.2, distinct from the previous item, designed to meet the high-quality criteria of the LBIDAT.

**Standard:** RI.8.2 – Determine a central idea of a text and analyze its development over the course of the text, including its relationship to supporting ideas.

**Passage:** James "Jim" Bridger

***

**Item Stem:**
The author develops the central idea that Jim Bridger was both a serious explorer and an entertaining personality primarily by—

**Answer Options:**
A. suggesting that he used his outrageous stories to distract settlers from the fact that he had not actually explored the Rocky Mountains.
B. contrasting the difficult life of a beaver trapper with the comfortable and easy lifestyle he led while running Fort Bridger.
C. describing his practical accomplishments, such as the discovery of Bridger’s Pass, alongside his reputation for telling tall tales.*
D. highlighting that he was the first to see the Great Salt Lake but failed to realize it was not an inlet of the Pacific Ocean.

***

**Rationales:**

*   **Option A:** This distractor is plausible because the text discusses his "outrageous stories" and the fact that some were "unbelievable." However, it is incorrect because the text explicitly validates his skills and exploration ("learned a great deal about the terrain," "valued guide"), contradicting the idea that the stories were a cover-up for a lack of experience.
*   **Option B:** This distractor is plausible because the text describes a transition from trapping in the mountains to running a fort. However, it is incorrect because the text does not use this transition to contrast the *difficulty* of the lifestyles; it focuses on how both roles served the expansion of the West.
*   **Option C (Key):** This option is correct because it analyzes the development of the central idea established in the introduction ("life story is as interesting as the tall tales") and conclusion ("remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller"). The author develops this by balancing paragraphs detailing his hard skills and discoveries (paragraphs 2-4, 7-8) with paragraphs detailing his humor and storytelling (paragraphs 5-6).
*   **Option D:** This distractor is plausible because it accurately recounts a specific event from the text regarding the Great Salt Lake. However, it is incorrect because this detail serves to illustrate the unknowns of the frontier, not to develop the central idea of his dual nature as a skilled guide and storyteller. It focuses on a single mistake rather than the broader development of his character.

### LBIDAT Self-Evaluation

**Stem & Task: ✓ (No Apparent Critical Issues)**
The task aligns with RI.8.2 by asking the student to identify the method used to develop a central idea (the duality of Bridger's legacy). It requires synthesizing information from different parts of the text (the "serious" sections and the "tall tale" sections) rather than recalling a single fact.

**The Key: ✓ (No Apparent Critical Issues)**
The key is definitively correct. The text structure explicitly supports this duality. The author dedicates specific sections to his "success at trapping" and "finding a short cut," while dedicating other sections to his "funny, extravagant" stories. The key accurately reflects this structural development.

**Distractors: ✓ (No Apparent Critical Issues)**
*   **Distractor A** posits a relationship between the supporting ideas (stories and exploration) that is cynical and contradicted by the text, though plausible to a student who misunderstands the purpose of the tall tales.
*   **Distractor B** infers a contrast (hard vs. easy) that is a common literary trope but is not the specific development used in this informational text.
*   **Distractor D** focuses on a specific supporting detail (the Salt Lake error) but fails to address the "personality" aspect of the central idea mentioned in the stem.

**Stimulus: ✓ (No Apparent Critical Issues)**
The stimulus supports this item well, as it contains distinct sections regarding his work and his storytelling, allowing for an analysis of how these ideas coexist.

**Fairness: ✓ (No Apparent Critical Issues)**
The item focuses on character analysis and text structure. It does not introduce sensitive topics or bias.

================== Passage Text =================

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

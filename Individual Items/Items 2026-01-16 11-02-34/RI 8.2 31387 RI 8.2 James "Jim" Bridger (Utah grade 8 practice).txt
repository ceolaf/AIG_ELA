Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

Looking at this passage about Jim Bridger, I'll create a multiple choice item aligned to RI.8.2 that examines how a central idea develops through its relationship to supporting ideas.

## Draft Multiple Choice Item:

**How does the central idea of Jim Bridger as a pioneering explorer develop throughout the passage?**

A. The passage begins by establishing Bridger's early exploration achievements, then shows how his discoveries led to practical contributions like Fort Bridger and Bridger's Pass, ultimately demonstrating how his knowledge made him valuable to westward expansion.

*B. The passage introduces Bridger's role in early expeditions, develops this through examples of his specific discoveries, then expands to show how his exploration expertise transformed into skills that served settlers moving west.

C. The passage focuses primarily on Bridger's storytelling abilities, using his exploration experiences mainly as background information to explain why people found his tall tales entertaining.

D. The passage presents Bridger's life chronologically without developing connections between his various accomplishments, simply listing his achievements from youth to retirement.

## Rationales:

**Option A:** A student might select this if they recognize Bridger as an explorer and see the practical contributions, but this option incorrectly suggests a direct causal relationship ("discoveries led to") between his early explorations and later establishments. The passage doesn't explicitly connect his early discoveries to Fort Bridger's founding.

***Option B (Key):*** This correctly identifies how the central idea develops: starting with Bridger's introduction to exploration (Missouri River expedition), developing through specific examples (Great Salt Lake, Yellowstone), then showing how this exploration expertise evolved into different but related roles (trapper, guide, fort owner) that all served westward expansion. This traces the actual development and transformation of the central idea.

**Option C:** Students might choose this if they were particularly drawn to the engaging section about tall tales. However, this misidentifies the central idea—storytelling is a supporting detail that illustrates Bridger's personality, not the main focus of the passage.

**Option D:** Students might select this if they recognize the chronological structure but fail to see the connections between ideas. This option incorrectly claims there's no development or relationship between the accomplishments, when the passage actually shows how Bridger's skills evolved and built upon each other.

## LBIDAT Evaluation:

- **Stem & Task:** ✓ (Appropriately targets analyzing development of central idea and its relationship to supporting ideas)
- **Key:** ✓ (Definitively correct and directly responsive)
- **Distractors:** ✓ (Each represents a plausible misunderstanding of the central idea's development)
- **Stimulus:** ✓ (Passage is grade-appropriate and necessary for the task)
- **Fairness:** ✓ (No sensitivity issues)

## Final Version:

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

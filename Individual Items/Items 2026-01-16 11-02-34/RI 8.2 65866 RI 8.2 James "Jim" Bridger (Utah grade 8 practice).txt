Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

Looking at this passage about Jim Bridger, I'll create a different multiple choice item aligned to RI.8.2 that examines how a central idea develops through its relationship to supporting ideas.

## Draft Multiple Choice Item:

**How does the passage develop the central idea that Bridger's knowledge of the western frontier made him valuable to American expansion?**

A. The passage first describes Bridger's childhood and apprenticeship, then lists his various discoveries, and concludes by mentioning places named after him to show his lasting fame.

B. The passage establishes Bridger's expertise through his early explorations and trapping success, then demonstrates how this knowledge directly benefited settlers through his trading post, guide services, and discovery of shorter routes.

C. The passage primarily develops this idea through Bridger's entertaining tall tales, which showed settlers that he understood the mysterious western territories better than anyone else.

*D. The passage builds this idea by first showing Bridger gaining firsthand experience of unexplored territories, then illustrating how he applied this knowledge in multiple roles—as a trapper, fort owner, guide, and route finder—each serving the needs of westward migration.

## Rationales:

**Option A:** Students might select this if they recognize the chronological structure but miss how the different elements connect to develop the central idea. This option treats the information as a simple list rather than showing how the supporting ideas build upon each other to develop the central concept of Bridger's valuable knowledge.

**Option B:** This option captures some of the development but oversimplifies the relationship by suggesting a direct, linear progression. Students might choose this if they see the connection between knowledge and benefits but miss the more complex development showing how Bridger's knowledge manifested in various interconnected roles.

**Option C:** Students might choose this if they were particularly engaged by the storytelling section. However, this misidentifies how the central idea develops—the tall tales are a supporting detail that adds color to Bridger's character but aren't the primary way the passage develops his value to expansion.

***Option D (Key):*** This correctly identifies how the central idea develops: the passage first establishes how Bridger gained unique knowledge through exploration, then shows multiple ways this knowledge made him valuable—not just as a guide, but through various roles that all drew upon and demonstrated his frontier expertise. This captures the full development and the relationships between supporting ideas.

## LBIDAT Evaluation:

- **Stem & Task:** ✓ (Appropriately targets analyzing development of a central idea through supporting ideas)
- **Key:** ✓ (Definitively correct and directly responsive)
- **Distractors:** ✓ (Each represents a plausible misunderstanding of how the central idea develops)
- **Stimulus:** ✓ (Passage is grade-appropriate and necessary for the task)
- **Fairness:** ✓ (No sensitivity issues)

## Final Version:

A. The passage first describes Bridger's childhood and apprenticeship, then lists his various discoveries, and concludes by mentioning places named after him to show his lasting fame.

================== Passage Text =================

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

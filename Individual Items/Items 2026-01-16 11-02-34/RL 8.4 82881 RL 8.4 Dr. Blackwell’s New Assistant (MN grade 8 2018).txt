## Multiple Choice Item for RL.8.4

**Question:**
In paragraph 8, the narrator describes feeling "unjustly reprimanded, like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar." How does this simile impact the tone of the narrator's reflection?

A. It creates a humorous tone by comparing medical training to childhood games.

*B. It emphasizes the narrator's frustration at being treated as incompetent despite her good intentions.

C. It suggests the narrator is too immature to handle the responsibilities of medical work.

D. It shows the narrator's guilt about making mistakes during patient care.

---

### Rationales:

**Option A (Incorrect):** Students might select this if they focus on the childhood imagery without considering the context. While the simile uses a childhood reference, the overall tone is not humorous but rather conveys the narrator's serious frustration and embarrassment at being publicly corrected.

**Option B (Correct):** This correctly identifies how the simile impacts tone. By comparing herself to a child caught misbehaving when she was actually trying to comfort a patient, the narrator emphasizes her sense of injustice and frustration. The word "unjustly" reinforces this interpretation, and the simile adds emotional depth to her feeling of being unfairly treated and diminished.

**Option C (Incorrect):** This distractor might appeal to students who misinterpret the purpose of the simile. The narrator isn't admitting immaturity; rather, she's expressing how Dr. Blackwell makes her feel. The passage shows the narrator is an experienced battlefield nurse, contradicting this interpretation.

**Option D (Incorrect):** Students might choose this if they misunderstand the word "caught" in the simile. The narrator doesn't feel guilty—she explicitly states the reprimand was "unjust." She was helping a nervous patient, not making a mistake, which is why she feels the criticism was unwarranted.

Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant

written for the Minnesota Department of Education

Elizabeth Blackwell was the first American woman to attend medical school. In 1857, unable to find work because of her gender, Dr. Blackwell opened her own clinic in New York, where her primary patients (and employees) were women. After the Civil War ended in 1865, she opened a medical school at the clinic to train other women to become doctors. The following is a fictional personal reflection written by a nurse who hopes to achieve this goal.

I was only a few days into my second week working under Miss . . . I mean, Dr. Blackwell, and already I felt that I could do nothing right.

Actually, my first mistake was not remembering to call her by her title. The idea of a woman doctor still required some adjustment, even though I harbored the hope of becoming one myself someday.

When I first heard of Elizabeth Blackwell and her accomplishments—the first American woman to be admitted to medical school, the first to become a doctor, the first to open her own clinic—she became my heroine. I saved as much money as I could from my nursing duties. When the war finally ended, I moved to New York and became one of her apprentices. My parents disapproved, of course; they thought I should return home and find a husband among the young men who survived the war. But after what I have seen and experienced at the battlefield, I know I can do more. I know that I am no longer satisfied with bandaging wounds and comforting the afflicted. I long to save lives, find cures for diseases, make the broken whole again. And now, someone has shown the world that women are as capable of accomplishing these deeds as any man.

However, my first week under Dr. Blackwell’s tutelage has, I fear, called my abilities into question. I was quite capable in my former role as a field nurse, but now I feel very self-conscious under her watchful eye. I either freeze like a statue or make all manner of clumsy blunders. If I was hoping to find a motherly figure in Dr. Blackwell, I was quickly disabused of that notion. On my very first day, when I failed to adequately prepare a tray of instruments, she thought nothing of reprimanding me in front of all the other students, nurses, and patients. Every day has brought at least one similar scolding. It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance.

I must somehow manage to do better, make no further mistakes, and gain the doctor’s respect, or she will send me away. That would extinguish my hopes, for the Women’s Medical College that Dr. Blackwell has founded here at the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children is the only institution of its kind.

This institution is sorely needed. Many women were made widows during the war. Others saw their husbands return to them so badly injured that they cannot possibly work. These women have little money for a doctor when they or their children become ill. Established doctors expect to be paid for their services. And so these less fortunate patients come to us.

I think the relief I see in these women’s faces, however, is based on more than financial concerns. Though the clinic accepts people who cannot pay, more than one young woman has communicated to me that she is more comfortable discussing her health problems with another woman than with a man. I am still not sure our patients are as confident in our abilities as they would be with those of a male doctor. Female physicians are still more of a curiosity than anything. These patients, however, cannot afford to doubt us.

Today I spoke soothingly to a nervous young woman who was in my charge, trying to calm her as I helped her onto the bed. The poor girl looked alarmed; her eyes darted back and forth, and her fingers trembled in my hands. She had obviously never been in a medical institution before.

 “Less chatter, please, Diana!” Dr. Blackwell snapped. “This is a hospital, not a place for idle conversation.” Once again, I felt unjustly reprimanded, like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar. As usual, I bit my tongue and said nothing. My patient forgot her fear for a moment and gave me a sympathetic look. That response only made me feel worse.

An industrial accident had occurred earlier in the day, so the night was unusually busy. I did not have the chance to stop and think but simply moved purposefully from one patient to the next, diagnosing problems and administering aid. Indeed, I was reminded of my time as a nurse on the battlefield during which rest was impossible to obtain.

Finally, the endless evening was finished. Only then did I turn to see Dr. Blackwell at my elbow. She had been assisting me all along, and I had not even acknowledged her. In fact, for the first time in almost two weeks, I had forgotten all about her. Now I was sure to be sent home.

But she was smiling at me.

“Well done, Diana!” she said. “Perhaps you will become a doctor after all.”

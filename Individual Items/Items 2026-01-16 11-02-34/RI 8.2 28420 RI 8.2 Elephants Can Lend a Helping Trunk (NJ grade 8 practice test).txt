Passage: RI 8.2 Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk (NJ grade 8 practice test).txt

Based on the passage "Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk," here is another multiple choice item aligned to RI.8.2:

**Item:**

Which summary best captures the key information presented in the passage?

A. Researchers modified a 1930s chimpanzee experiment for elephants, teaching them to pull ropes attached to a sliding table. The elephants learned to wait for their partners before pulling, proving they could be trained to work in pairs for food rewards.

B. *Scientists tested Asian elephants' cooperative abilities using a rope-pulling experiment and found that elephants understand when they need help from others, demonstrating advanced social cognition that places them among a select group of cooperative species.

C. A team of scientists at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center discovered that elephants are superior to chimpanzees at cooperative tasks. The elephants waited longer than any other species tested and could even help fallen elephants in the wild.

D. Elephants in Thailand participated in psychology experiments where they had to pull ropes simultaneously to get corn. When researchers made the tasks harder by releasing elephants at different times, some elephants failed while others succeeded.

**Rationales:**

**Option A:** This distractor provides accurate details about the experiment but misses the significance of the findings. It focuses on the procedural aspects and training rather than what the experiment revealed about elephant cognition. Students choosing this may be summarizing the "what" without understanding the "why" of the research.

**Option B (Correct Answer):** This summary effectively captures both the main methodology (rope-pulling experiment testing cooperation) and the central finding (elephants understand when they need help, showing advanced social cognition). It also includes the important conclusion about elephants joining other cooperative species, which frames the significance of the discovery.

**Option C:** This distractor contains inaccuracies and overstatements. The passage doesn't claim elephants are "superior" to chimpanzees overall, only that they learned one aspect faster. It also incorrectly states elephants waited longer than "any other species tested." Students selecting this may have misinterpreted comparative statements or made unsupported inferences.

**Option D:** This distractor provides a fragmented and incomplete summary that misrepresents the results. It incorrectly suggests some elephants failed while others succeeded in the different-time release experiment, when actually the passage indicates they learned to wait. Students choosing this may have difficulty synthesizing information across paragraphs or distinguishing between experimental conditions and results.

Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk
by Virginia Morell 


Elephants know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk. That’s the conclusion of a new study that tested the cooperative skills of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand and showed that the pachyderms understand that they will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance. The ability to recognize that you sometimes need a little help from your friends is a sign of higher social cognition, psychologists say, and is rarely found in other species. Elephants now join an elite club of social cooperators: chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.

To test the elephants’ cooperation skills, a team of scientists modified a classic experiment first administered to chimpanzees in the 1930s, which requires two animals work together to earn a treat. If they don’t cooperate, neither gets the reward. For the elephants, the researchers used a sliding table with a single rope threaded around it. Two bowls of corn were attached to the table, but the elephants could reach them only by pulling two ends of the rope simultaneously. Working with mahout—Asian elephant trainers—trained elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, the researchers first taught individual animals to pull the rope with their trunks. The 12 elephants were then divided into six pairs, and each pair was released to walk to their waiting ropes. If one animal pulled the rope before the other, the rope would slip out, leaving the table—and treats—in place. “That taught them to pull together,” says Joshua Plotnik, a postdoc in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the lead author of the study, which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To find out if the elephants understood that they needed one another’s assistance, the researchers upped the challenge by releasing the elephants at different times. Thus, one elephant would arrive at the table before the other and would have to wait for a partner to show up before pulling the rope. “They learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” says Plotnik. “They would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting.” In another experiment, the partner’s rope was placed out of reach. “When the partner couldn’t do anything, the other one would just give up,” Plotnik says. That shows the elephants understood why the partner was needed, he adds.

“These are clever experiments,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who studies social cognition in wild elephants. The findings are consistent with observations in nature, she says. For instance, in East Africa biologists have seen elephants work together to lift a fallen companion with their tusks. “It’s particularly striking that the elephants were able to inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees do, comparative psychologist Nicola Clayton of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She and her team showed that rooks, too, could pass a similar dual-rope exam, although they failed to wait. The study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”

Passage: RL 8.4 Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant (MN grade 8 2018).txt

Here is a unique multiple-choice item aligned to CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.8.4, designed to meet the LBIDAT criteria.

**Item Draft**

**Standard:** CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.8.4  
**Passage:** Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant  
**Grade:** 8

**Stem:**
Read the sentence from paragraph 5.

“That would **extinguish** my hopes, for the Women’s Medical College that Dr. Blackwell has founded here at the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children is the only institution of its kind.”

How does the author’s use of the word *extinguish* impact the meaning of the sentence?

A. It suggests that the narrator’s ambition was becoming dangerous and needed to be controlled.
B. It implies that the narrator worried the medical college was in danger of closing down permanently.
*C. It emphasizes the absolute finality of the loss the narrator faces if she fails at this specific clinic.
D. It indicates that the narrator’s interest in becoming a doctor was slowly fading away due to the stress.

**Rationales:**

*   **Option A is incorrect.** This distractor appeals to the metaphorical association of "extinguish" with fire. A student might reason that fire is dangerous and must be put out (controlled). However, the text does not portray her ambition as negative or dangerous; it portrays it as a positive "hope" that she wants to keep alive.
*   **Option B is incorrect.** This distractor is a misreading of the sentence structure. While "extinguish" can mean to put an end to something, the object of the verb is "my hopes," not the "Women's Medical College." The student might choose this if they associate "extinguish" with "closing" a business but fail to track the specific grammar of the sentence.
*   **Option C is the correct answer.** The standard asks for the impact of specific word choices. "Extinguish" denotes putting out a fire or light completely. In this context, the author uses it metaphorically to describe the death of the narrator's dreams. The impact of choosing "extinguish" rather than "hurt" or "delay" creates a tone of high stakes and desperation. Because the text states this is the "only institution of its kind," being sent away would not just be a setback; it would completely snuff out her career possibilities like a candle flame.
*   **Option D is incorrect.** This distractor contrasts the definition of "extinguish" with a different kind of loss. "Extinguish" implies a sudden, decisive action (being sent away). "Slowly fading" implies a gradual loss of interest. The context of the paragraph—the fear of being sent away immediately—contradicts the idea of a slow fade.

**LBIDAT Evaluation**

**Stem & Task: ✓**
The task explicitly requires the student to analyze the impact of a specific word choice within the context of the sentence and the broader text, which is the core of standard RL.8.4. It moves beyond simple definition to the *implication* of the word (finality/high stakes).

**The Key: ✓**
The key is definitively correct based on the textual evidence ("only institution of its kind") and the denotative/connotative meaning of "extinguish" (complete removal/putting out).

**Distractors: ✓**
*   **Distractor A:** Plausible based on the "fire" metaphor inherent in the word, representing a misconception of the metaphor's application.
*   **Distractor B:** Plausible based on a misreading of the sentence syntax (what is being extinguished), a common error.
*   **Distractor D:** Plausible as it deals with the loss of hope, but incorrect regarding the *manner* of the loss (sudden vs. gradual), testing the precision of the word choice analysis.
All distractors are definitively incorrect but grounded in potential student errors regarding metaphor, syntax, or nuance.

**Stimulus: ✓**
The stimulus is a direct excerpt from the passage and is accurate. The item requires the stimulus to answer the question but also relies on the surrounding context mentioned in the excerpt (that the college is the "only one").

**Fairness: ✓**
The item raises no sensitivity issues. The metaphor of "extinguishing hopes" is a standard literary device and does not evoke inappropriate emotional distress or bias.

Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant

written for the Minnesota Department of Education

Elizabeth Blackwell was the first American woman to attend medical school. In 1857, unable to find work because of her gender, Dr. Blackwell opened her own clinic in New York, where her primary patients (and employees) were women. After the Civil War ended in 1865, she opened a medical school at the clinic to train other women to become doctors. The following is a fictional personal reflection written by a nurse who hopes to achieve this goal.

I was only a few days into my second week working under Miss . . . I mean, Dr. Blackwell, and already I felt that I could do nothing right.

Actually, my first mistake was not remembering to call her by her title. The idea of a woman doctor still required some adjustment, even though I harbored the hope of becoming one myself someday.

When I first heard of Elizabeth Blackwell and her accomplishments—the first American woman to be admitted to medical school, the first to become a doctor, the first to open her own clinic—she became my heroine. I saved as much money as I could from my nursing duties. When the war finally ended, I moved to New York and became one of her apprentices. My parents disapproved, of course; they thought I should return home and find a husband among the young men who survived the war. But after what I have seen and experienced at the battlefield, I know I can do more. I know that I am no longer satisfied with bandaging wounds and comforting the afflicted. I long to save lives, find cures for diseases, make the broken whole again. And now, someone has shown the world that women are as capable of accomplishing these deeds as any man.

However, my first week under Dr. Blackwell’s tutelage has, I fear, called my abilities into question. I was quite capable in my former role as a field nurse, but now I feel very self-conscious under her watchful eye. I either freeze like a statue or make all manner of clumsy blunders. If I was hoping to find a motherly figure in Dr. Blackwell, I was quickly disabused of that notion. On my very first day, when I failed to adequately prepare a tray of instruments, she thought nothing of reprimanding me in front of all the other students, nurses, and patients. Every day has brought at least one similar scolding. It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance.

I must somehow manage to do better, make no further mistakes, and gain the doctor’s respect, or she will send me away. That would extinguish my hopes, for the Women’s Medical College that Dr. Blackwell has founded here at the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children is the only institution of its kind.

This institution is sorely needed. Many women were made widows during the war. Others saw their husbands return to them so badly injured that they cannot possibly work. These women have little money for a doctor when they or their children become ill. Established doctors expect to be paid for their services. And so these less fortunate patients come to us.

I think the relief I see in these women’s faces, however, is based on more than financial concerns. Though the clinic accepts people who cannot pay, more than one young woman has communicated to me that she is more comfortable discussing her health problems with another woman than with a man. I am still not sure our patients are as confident in our abilities as they would be with those of a male doctor. Female physicians are still more of a curiosity than anything. These patients, however, cannot afford to doubt us.

Today I spoke soothingly to a nervous young woman who was in my charge, trying to calm her as I helped her onto the bed. The poor girl looked alarmed; her eyes darted back and forth, and her fingers trembled in my hands. She had obviously never been in a medical institution before.

 “Less chatter, please, Diana!” Dr. Blackwell snapped. “This is a hospital, not a place for idle conversation.” Once again, I felt unjustly reprimanded, like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar. As usual, I bit my tongue and said nothing. My patient forgot her fear for a moment and gave me a sympathetic look. That response only made me feel worse.

An industrial accident had occurred earlier in the day, so the night was unusually busy. I did not have the chance to stop and think but simply moved purposefully from one patient to the next, diagnosing problems and administering aid. Indeed, I was reminded of my time as a nurse on the battlefield during which rest was impossible to obtain.

Finally, the endless evening was finished. Only then did I turn to see Dr. Blackwell at my elbow. She had been assisting me all along, and I had not even acknowledged her. In fact, for the first time in almost two weeks, I had forgotten all about her. Now I was sure to be sent home.

But she was smiling at me.

“Well done, Diana!” she said. “Perhaps you will become a doctor after all.”

Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

**Item Writer’s Note:**
This item targets CCSS RI.8.2 by requiring the student to analyze the structure of the author's argument. The student must recognize that the central idea (Bridger’s status as a multifaceted legend) is built by synthesizing two distinct categories of supporting details present in the text: his tangible, physical contributions to westward expansion and his intangible, cultural contributions through personality and storytelling.

***

**Item Stem:**
Which statement best analyzes how the text develops the central idea that Jim Bridger was a unique and multifaceted figure of the American frontier?

**Answer Options:**

A. By emphasizing that his ability to tell entertaining tall tales was the primary reason settlers trusted him to lead them through the dangerous Rocky Mountains.
B. By combining evidence of his practical achievements, such as establishing a trading post and discovering a pass, with descriptions of the personality traits that made him famous.*
C. By contrasting his early serious work as a blacksmith’s apprentice with his later years, suggesting that he eventually abandoned hard labor to become a storyteller.
D. By listing the specific dates of his expeditions and retirement to demonstrate that his longevity was the most important factor in his legendary status.

**Rationales:**

*   **Option A:** This option is incorrect. It creates a false causal relationship between two ideas in the text. While the text states that settlers enjoyed his stories (social interaction), it explicitly states that people hired him as a guide "Because of his knowledge and skills" regarding the terrain and wildlife, not because of his stories.
*   **Option B:** This is the correct answer. The text develops the portrait of Bridger by integrating details about his "hard skills" (trapping, building Fort Bridger, finding the pass for the railroad) with details about his "soft skills" (his humor, charisma, and tall tales). The student must recognize that the author uses both types of supporting ideas to build the full central idea of Bridger as both a "skilled mountain man and storyteller."
*   **Option C:** This option is incorrect. This misinterprets the development of the text. The text does not present his life as a contrast where he abandons work; rather, it shows a progression where he used his skills to build the Fort and then worked for twenty years as a guide. The storytelling was a concurrent activity, not a replacement for his work.
*   **Option D:** This option is incorrect. This option focuses on the chronological structure (dates) but fails to analyze the development of the *ideas*. The text does not support the claim that his age/longevity was the "most important factor" in his status; rather, it credits his skills, discoveries, and personality.

================== Passage Text =================

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

**Item ID:** RI.8.2-ElephantCognition
**Grade:** 8
**Standard:** RI.8.2 - Determine a central idea of a text and analyze its development over the course of the text, including its relationship to supporting ideas; provide an objective summary of the text.

**Item Stem:**
A central idea of the text is that the elephants’ ability to cooperate is based on "higher social cognition" (an intellectual understanding of the task) rather than simple rote learning. Which statement best analyzes how the author develops this distinction using the supporting details in paragraph 3?

**Answer Options:**

A. The author contrasts the elephants’ speed of learning with that of chimpanzees to show that elephants rely more on instinct than on cognitive problem-solving.

B. The author describes the elephants’ refusal to pull the rope when a partner’s rope was out of reach to demonstrate that they understood the cause-and-effect relationship of the partnership.*

C. The author explains the mahouts’ role in training the elephants to suggest that what appears to be social cognition is actually the result of rigorous human instruction.

D. The author highlights the elephants’ ability to wait for a partner to argue that patience is a separate, unrelated skill from the ability to cooperate on a physical task.

**Rationales:**

*   **Option A:** This is a distractor. While the text compares elephants to chimpanzees, the author states that elephants learned *faster* and inhibited pulling longer. The text uses this comparison to support the elephants' superior or equal cognitive standing, not to suggest they rely on instinct over problem-solving.
*   **Option B:** **This is the correct answer.** The central idea hinges on the difference between just pulling a rope (a trick) and knowing *why* to pull the rope (cognition). The author supports this by describing a specific scenario where the elephants stopped working because they saw the partner could not help. This supporting detail proves they understood the mechanism of cooperation, thereby developing the central idea of "higher social cognition."
*   **Option C:** This is a distractor. The text mentions the mahouts in paragraph 2 to explain the setup of the experiment. However, the author does not use this detail to undermine the central idea of social cognition; rather, the training was a prerequisite to test the cognition in the later phases (delayed release). This option misinterprets the relationship between the training and the study's conclusions.
*   **Option D:** This is a distractor. The author mentions the elephants' patience (waiting for the partner) as evidence *of* their social cognition, not as a separate, unrelated skill. The author uses the concept of waiting to reinforce the idea that the elephants understood the partner was necessary.

Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk
by Virginia Morell 


Elephants know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk. That’s the conclusion of a new study that tested the cooperative skills of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand and showed that the pachyderms understand that they will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance. The ability to recognize that you sometimes need a little help from your friends is a sign of higher social cognition, psychologists say, and is rarely found in other species. Elephants now join an elite club of social cooperators: chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.

To test the elephants’ cooperation skills, a team of scientists modified a classic experiment first administered to chimpanzees in the 1930s, which requires two animals work together to earn a treat. If they don’t cooperate, neither gets the reward. For the elephants, the researchers used a sliding table with a single rope threaded around it. Two bowls of corn were attached to the table, but the elephants could reach them only by pulling two ends of the rope simultaneously. Working with mahout—Asian elephant trainers—trained elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, the researchers first taught individual animals to pull the rope with their trunks. The 12 elephants were then divided into six pairs, and each pair was released to walk to their waiting ropes. If one animal pulled the rope before the other, the rope would slip out, leaving the table—and treats—in place. “That taught them to pull together,” says Joshua Plotnik, a postdoc in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the lead author of the study, which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To find out if the elephants understood that they needed one another’s assistance, the researchers upped the challenge by releasing the elephants at different times. Thus, one elephant would arrive at the table before the other and would have to wait for a partner to show up before pulling the rope. “They learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” says Plotnik. “They would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting.” In another experiment, the partner’s rope was placed out of reach. “When the partner couldn’t do anything, the other one would just give up,” Plotnik says. That shows the elephants understood why the partner was needed, he adds.

“These are clever experiments,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who studies social cognition in wild elephants. The findings are consistent with observations in nature, she says. For instance, in East Africa biologists have seen elephants work together to lift a fallen companion with their tusks. “It’s particularly striking that the elephants were able to inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees do, comparative psychologist Nicola Clayton of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She and her team showed that rooks, too, could pass a similar dual-rope exam, although they failed to wait. The study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”

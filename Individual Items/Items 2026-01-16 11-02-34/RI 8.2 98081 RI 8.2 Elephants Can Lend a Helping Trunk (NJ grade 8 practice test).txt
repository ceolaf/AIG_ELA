Passage: RI 8.2 Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk (NJ grade 8 practice test).txt

2. How does the author develop the central idea that elephants possess advanced social cooperation and understanding?

A. By describing how elephants are trained by mahouts and then explaining how this training makes them better at solving problems than other animals.  
B. By stating that elephants are part of an “elite club” of cooperators and then providing detailed descriptions of rope-pulling experiments and expert commentary that support this claim. *  
C. By comparing the physical features of elephants, chimpanzees, hyenas, and rooks and showing that elephants’ trunks make them naturally more cooperative.  
D. By focusing on wild elephant behavior, such as lifting a fallen companion, and only briefly mentioning that some scientists have tested them in laboratories.

Rationales:

**Option B (Correct)**  
- Central idea: Elephants have advanced social cooperation and understanding (a form of higher social cognition).  
- Development across the text:  
  - The author first introduces the conclusion that elephants can recognize when they need help and places them in an “elite club” of social cooperators.  
  - The passage then describes the basic rope-pulling experiment and the more challenging versions (delayed release and out-of-reach rope) that reveal elephants understand *why* a partner is needed.  
  - Finally, the author includes expert commentary and field observations (like lifting a fallen elephant) that reinforce and broaden this central idea.  
- This option correctly identifies both the central idea and the way the author builds it with experiments plus expert support.

**Option A (Distractor)**  
- The passage does mention mahouts and training, but only as background for how elephants learned the rope task.  
- The central idea is not that training makes elephants better problem-solvers than other animals; the text never compares their problem-solving *because* of training.  
- This option misidentifies a minor procedural detail as the main method of development.

**Option C (Distractor)**  
- The passage does not compare physical features (like trunks vs. hands or beaks) as a reason for cooperation.  
- Elephants’ cooperation is presented as a cognitive ability, not something caused by body structure.  
- This option invents a comparison and development strategy that the author does not use.

**Option D (Distractor)**  
- While the author does mention a wild behavior example (lifting a fallen companion), it appears near the end as supporting evidence, not as the primary focus.  
- The passage mainly centers on controlled experiments at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center, not “only briefly” on lab tests.  
- This reverses the emphasis of the text and misrepresents how the central idea is developed.

Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk
by Virginia Morell 


Elephants know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk. That’s the conclusion of a new study that tested the cooperative skills of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand and showed that the pachyderms understand that they will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance. The ability to recognize that you sometimes need a little help from your friends is a sign of higher social cognition, psychologists say, and is rarely found in other species. Elephants now join an elite club of social cooperators: chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.

To test the elephants’ cooperation skills, a team of scientists modified a classic experiment first administered to chimpanzees in the 1930s, which requires two animals work together to earn a treat. If they don’t cooperate, neither gets the reward. For the elephants, the researchers used a sliding table with a single rope threaded around it. Two bowls of corn were attached to the table, but the elephants could reach them only by pulling two ends of the rope simultaneously. Working with mahout—Asian elephant trainers—trained elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, the researchers first taught individual animals to pull the rope with their trunks. The 12 elephants were then divided into six pairs, and each pair was released to walk to their waiting ropes. If one animal pulled the rope before the other, the rope would slip out, leaving the table—and treats—in place. “That taught them to pull together,” says Joshua Plotnik, a postdoc in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the lead author of the study, which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To find out if the elephants understood that they needed one another’s assistance, the researchers upped the challenge by releasing the elephants at different times. Thus, one elephant would arrive at the table before the other and would have to wait for a partner to show up before pulling the rope. “They learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” says Plotnik. “They would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting.” In another experiment, the partner’s rope was placed out of reach. “When the partner couldn’t do anything, the other one would just give up,” Plotnik says. That shows the elephants understood why the partner was needed, he adds.

“These are clever experiments,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who studies social cognition in wild elephants. The findings are consistent with observations in nature, she says. For instance, in East Africa biologists have seen elephants work together to lift a fallen companion with their tusks. “It’s particularly striking that the elephants were able to inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees do, comparative psychologist Nicola Clayton of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She and her team showed that rooks, too, could pass a similar dual-rope exam, although they failed to wait. The study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”

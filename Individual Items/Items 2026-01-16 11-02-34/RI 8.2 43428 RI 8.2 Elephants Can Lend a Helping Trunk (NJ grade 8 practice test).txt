Passage: RI 8.2 Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk (NJ grade 8 practice test).txt

1. Which statement best explains how the author develops a central idea of the passage?

A. The author shows that elephants are physically strong by describing how they pull heavy tables and lift fallen companions.  
B. The author introduces elephants’ need for cooperation, then describes experiments and wild observations that show elephants understand when and why they need a partner’s help.*  
C. The author argues that elephants are smarter than chimpanzees by comparing how quickly each species learns to pull a rope.  
D. The author explains how mahouts train elephants step by step so readers can see that elephants only cooperate because humans teach them to.

**Correct Answer: B***

---

### Rationales

**A. The author shows that elephants are physically strong by describing how they pull heavy tables and lift fallen companions.**

- This option misidentifies the central idea as physical strength.  
- While the passage mentions elephants pulling the table and lifting a fallen elephant, those details support the idea of cooperation and social cognition, not strength.  
- Students choosing this likely focused on concrete actions instead of the author’s focus on “higher social cognition” and “cooperation.”

**B. The author introduces elephants’ need for cooperation, then describes experiments and wild observations that show elephants understand when and why they need a partner’s help.* (Key)**

- The central idea is that elephants have advanced social cognition, including understanding when they need a partner to succeed.  
- Paragraph 1 states this idea directly: elephants “know when they need a helping hand” and are part of an “elite club of social cooperators.”  
- The following paragraphs trace its development:
  - The rope-and-table experiment shows elephants must pull together to get food.  
  - The delayed-release and out-of-reach-rope trials show elephants understand they need a partner and why.  
  - Quotes from other scientists and examples from the wild (lifting a fallen companion) reinforce and extend this idea.  
- This option correctly captures both the central idea and how the author develops it through experiments and supporting observations.

**C. The author argues that elephants are smarter than chimpanzees by comparing how quickly each species learns to pull a rope.**

- This overstates and distorts the author’s claim.  
- The passage notes that elephants “learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” but the main focus is not a competition over which species is “smarter.”  
- The comparisons to chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans serve to show elephants belong to a group of species with advanced social cooperation, not to rank intelligence.  
- Students choosing this may latch onto the comparison detail without considering the broader pattern of evidence.

**D. The author explains how mahouts train elephants step by step so readers can see that elephants only cooperate because humans teach them to.**

- The training by mahouts is mentioned briefly as setup, not as the main focus.  
- The central idea is about elephants’ own understanding of cooperation, not about human training methods.  
- The experiments are designed to test whether elephants recognize they need a partner, not to show that cooperation exists only because of human teaching.  
- This choice misreads the role of training in the study and confuses background procedure with the central idea.

Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk
by Virginia Morell 


Elephants know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk. That’s the conclusion of a new study that tested the cooperative skills of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand and showed that the pachyderms understand that they will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance. The ability to recognize that you sometimes need a little help from your friends is a sign of higher social cognition, psychologists say, and is rarely found in other species. Elephants now join an elite club of social cooperators: chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.

To test the elephants’ cooperation skills, a team of scientists modified a classic experiment first administered to chimpanzees in the 1930s, which requires two animals work together to earn a treat. If they don’t cooperate, neither gets the reward. For the elephants, the researchers used a sliding table with a single rope threaded around it. Two bowls of corn were attached to the table, but the elephants could reach them only by pulling two ends of the rope simultaneously. Working with mahout—Asian elephant trainers—trained elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, the researchers first taught individual animals to pull the rope with their trunks. The 12 elephants were then divided into six pairs, and each pair was released to walk to their waiting ropes. If one animal pulled the rope before the other, the rope would slip out, leaving the table—and treats—in place. “That taught them to pull together,” says Joshua Plotnik, a postdoc in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the lead author of the study, which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To find out if the elephants understood that they needed one another’s assistance, the researchers upped the challenge by releasing the elephants at different times. Thus, one elephant would arrive at the table before the other and would have to wait for a partner to show up before pulling the rope. “They learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” says Plotnik. “They would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting.” In another experiment, the partner’s rope was placed out of reach. “When the partner couldn’t do anything, the other one would just give up,” Plotnik says. That shows the elephants understood why the partner was needed, he adds.

“These are clever experiments,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who studies social cognition in wild elephants. The findings are consistent with observations in nature, she says. For instance, in East Africa biologists have seen elephants work together to lift a fallen companion with their tusks. “It’s particularly striking that the elephants were able to inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees do, comparative psychologist Nicola Clayton of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She and her team showed that rooks, too, could pass a similar dual-rope exam, although they failed to wait. The study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”

### Item Draft

**Standard:** CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.8.4
Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text, including figurative and connotative meanings; analyze the impact of specific word choices on meaning and tone, including analogies or allusions to other texts.

**Passage:** Excerpt from *O Pioneers!*

**Item:**
Read the sentence from the third paragraph.

“She wore a man’s long ulster (not as if it were an affliction, but as if it were very comfortable and belonged to her; carried it like a young soldier), and a round plush cap, tied down with a thick veil.”

What is the effect of the author's comparison of the sister to a “young soldier”?

A. It implies that she feels burdened by the weight of the heavy coat.
B. It suggests that she is attempting to disguise her true identity.
C. It characterizes her as commanding and self-assured. *
D. It indicates that she has an aggressive and combative personality.

**Rationales:**

*   **A. It implies that she feels burdened by the weight of the heavy coat.**
    *   *Rationale:* This distractor appeals to students who focus on the description of the "man's long ulster" (a heavy coat) without reading the parenthetical text. It is definitively incorrect because the text explicitly states she wore it "not as if it were an affliction" (a burden) but as if it were "very comfortable."
*   **B. It suggests that she is attempting to disguise her true identity.**
    *   *Rationale:* This distractor appeals to a misconception regarding a female character wearing men's clothing ("man's long ulster"). A student might infer she is hiding or disguising herself. However, the text states the coat looked as if it "belonged to her," suggesting ownership and confidence rather than concealment.
*   **C. It characterizes her as commanding and self-assured. (*)**
    *   *Rationale:* This is the correct answer. The simile "carried it like a young soldier" is used to describe her posture and demeanor. Combined with the context clues "resolutely" and "as if she knew exactly where she was going," the comparison highlights her strength, confidence, and ability to command her environment, much like a disciplined soldier.
*   **D. It indicates that she has an aggressive and combative personality.**
    *   *Rationale:* This distractor appeals to a negative connotation of the word "soldier" (fighting/war). A student might choose this if they associate soldiers primarily with violence. However, the surrounding text describes her face as "serious" and "thoughtful" rather than angry or violent, making this interpretation incorrect in context.

### LBIDAT Evaluation of the Item

Below is an analysis of how this item performs against the LBIDAT criteria.

**Stem & Task: ✓ (No Apparent Critical Issues)**
The task asks the student to analyze the impact of a specific analogy (simile) on the characterization of a figure in the text. This aligns directly with the "analogies or allusions" aspect of Standard RL.8.4. The task requires the student to synthesize the figurative language with the specific context clues provided in the sentence (the parenthetical explanation).

**The Key: ✓ (No Apparent Critical Issues)**
The key (Option C) is definitively correct. The text provides explicit support for this interpretation. The phrase "walked rapidly and resolutely" precedes the sentence, and the parenthetical note clarifies that the coat is worn with comfort and ownership. "Young soldier" in this context conveys discipline and strength (posture), which aligns with "self-assured."

**Distractors: ✓ (No Apparent Critical Issues)**
*   **Direct Response:** All distractors answer the question regarding the "effect" of the comparison.
*   **Plausibility:**
    *   Option A is a plausible misreading if the student ignores the "not" in "not as if it were an affliction."
    *   Option B is a plausible inference based on the "man's coat" element, often a trope in literature for disguise.
    *   Option D is a plausible association with the word "soldier" if the tone is ignored.
*   **Definitively Incorrect:**
    *   A is ruled out by the text "not as if it were an affliction."
    *   B is ruled out by the text "belonged to her."
    *   D is ruled out by the description of her "thoughtful" face and "deep blue eyes... fixed intently."

**Stimulus: ✓ (No Apparent Critical Issues)**
The stimulus is appropriate. The item requires close reading of the specific sentence structure (specifically the parenthetical aside) to arrive at the correct answer.

**Fairness: ✓ (No Apparent Critical Issues)**
There are no sensitivity issues. The reference to a "soldier" is used metaphorically for posture and confidence, not violence. The gender dynamics (girl wearing a man's coat) are handled in a literary context emphasizing strength, which is generally viewed positively in fairness reviews.

Excerpt from O Pioneers!

by Willa Cather

One January day, thirty years ago, the little town of Hanover, anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland, was trying not to be blown away. A mist of fine snowflakes was curling and eddying about the cluster of low drab buildings huddled on the gray prairie, under a gray sky. The dwelling- houses were set about haphazard on the tough prairie sod; some of them looked as if they had been moved in overnight, and others as if they were straying off by themselves, headed straight for the open plain. None of them had any appearance of permanence, and the howling wind blew under them as well as over them. The main street was a deeply rutted road, now frozen hard, which ran from the squat red railway station and the grain “elevator” at the north end of the town to the lumber yard and the horse pond at the south end. On either side of this road straggled two uneven rows of wooden buildings; the general merchandise stores, the two banks, the drug store, the feed store, the saloon, the post- office. The board sidewalks were gray with trampled snow, but at two o’clock in the afternoon the shopkeepers, having come back from dinner, were keeping well behind their frosty windows. The children were all in school, and there was nobody abroad in the streets but a few rough- looking countrymen in coarse overcoats, with their long caps pulled down to their noses. Some of them had brought their wives to town, and now and then a red or a plaid shawl flashed out of one store into the shelter of another. At the hitch- bars along the street a few heavy work- horses, harnessed to farm wagons, shivered under their blankets. About the station everything was quiet, for there would not be another train in until night.

On the sidewalk in front of one of the stores sat a little Swede boy, crying bitterly. He was about five years old. His black cloth coat was much too big for him and made him look like a little old man. His shrunken brown flannel dress had been washed many times and left a long stretch of stocking between the hem of his skirt and the tops of his clumsy, copper- toed shoes. His cap was pulled down over his ears; his nose and his chubby cheeks were chapped and red with cold. He cried quietly, and the few people who hurried by did not notice him. He was afraid to stop any one, afraid to go into the store and ask for help, so he sat wringing his long sleeves and looking up a telegraph pole beside him, whimpering, “My kitten, oh, my kitten! Her will fweeze!” At the top of the pole crouched a shivering gray kitten, mewing faintly and clinging desperately to the wood with her claws. The boy had been left at the store while his sister went to the doctor’s office, and in her absence a dog had chased his kitten up the pole. The little creature had never been so high before, and she was too frightened to move. Her master was sunk in despair. He was a little country boy, and this village was to him a very strange and perplexing place, where people wore fine clothes and had hard hearts. He always felt shy and awkward here, and wanted to hide behind things for fear someone might laugh at him. Just now, he was too unhappy to care who laughed. At last he seemed to see a ray of hope: his sister was coming, and he got up and ran toward her in his heavy shoes.

His sister was a tall, strong girl, and she walked rapidly and resolutely, as if she knew exactly where she was going and what she was going to do next. She wore a man’s long ulster1 (not as if it were an affliction, but as if it were very comfortable and belonged to her; carried it like a young soldier), and a round plush cap, tied down with a thick veil. She had a serious, thoughtful face, and her clear, deep blue eyes were fixed intently on the distance, without seeming to see anything, as if she were in trouble. She did not notice the little boy until he pulled her by the coat. Then she stopped short and stooped down to wipe his wet face.

“Why, Emil! I told you to stay in the store and not to come out. What is the matter with you?”

“My kitten, sister, my kitten! A man put her out, and a dog chased her up there.” His forefinger, projecting from the sleeve of his coat, pointed up to the wretched little creature on the pole.

“Oh, Emil! Didn’t I tell you she’d get us into trouble of some kind, if you brought her? What made you tease me so? But there, I ought to have known better myself.” She went to the foot of the pole and held out her arms, crying, “Kitty, kitty, kitty,” but the kitten only mewed and faintly waved its tail. Alexandra turned away decidedly. “No, she won’t come down. Somebody will have to go up after her. I saw the Linstrums’ wagon in town. I’ll go and see if I can find Carl. Maybe he can do something. Only you must stop crying, or I won’t go a step. Where’s your comforter? Did you leave it in the store? Never mind. Hold still, till I put this on you.”

She unwound the brown veil from her head and tied it about his throat.

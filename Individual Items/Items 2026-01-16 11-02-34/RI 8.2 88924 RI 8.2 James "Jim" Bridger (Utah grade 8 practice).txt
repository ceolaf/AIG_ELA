Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

**Item Writer’s Note:**
The following item is designed to meet the rigorous demands of CCSS RI.8.2. It moves beyond simple identification of a central idea (a Grade 6 skill) or merely tracing its development (a Grade 7 skill). Instead, it asks the student to analyze the *relationship* between supporting ideas (Bridger’s specific skills and discoveries) and the central idea (his pivotal role in westward expansion). The correct answer requires synthesizing details from the beginning, middle, and end of the text to understand how the author constructs the argument for Bridger's significance.

***

**Item Stem:**
Which statement best explains how the central idea that Jim Bridger was instrumental in the expansion of the American West is developed in the text?

**Answer Options:**

A. By contrasting his early failure to correctly identify the Great Salt Lake with his later successful discovery of a shortcut through the Rocky Mountains.
B. By demonstrating how Bridger applied the knowledge of the terrain he gained through trapping and exploring to establish necessary resources and routes for future travelers.*
C. By describing the tall tales Bridger told to settlers at his fort to show that his fame was based primarily on his personality rather than his exploration skills.
D. By listing the various locations he visited, such as Yellowstone and the Bear River, to prove that he traveled more miles than any other explorer of his time.

**Rationales:**

*   **Option A:** This option is incorrect. While the text mentions the mistake regarding the Great Salt Lake and the success of Bridger’s Pass, the text does not structure the central idea as a contrast between failure and success. Rather, the text presents a cumulative progression of his skills and contributions.
*   **Option B:** This is the correct answer. The text develops the central idea of Bridger’s importance by linking his supporting experiences (early exploration, beaver trapping) to the specific ways those experiences aided expansion (building Fort Bridger for supplies, using his knowledge to guide others, discovering Bridger’s Pass for the railroad). This option correctly analyzes the relationship between the supporting details and the central idea.
*   **Option C:** This option is incorrect. While the text discusses Bridger’s tall tales as a supporting detail of his life, the text explicitly states he is remembered for being a "skilled mountain man" *and* a storyteller. The text does not develop the idea that his fame was *primarily* based on personality; it emphasizes his physical contributions (the Fort, the Pass) as key factors in his legacy.
*   **Option D:** This option is incorrect. While the text supports the idea that Bridger was well-traveled, it does not make the comparative claim that he traveled "more miles than any other explorer." Furthermore, a mere list of locations does not analyze *how* the text develops the idea of his instrumentality in the West's expansion (i.e., by facilitating the movement of others).

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

## Multiple Choice Item for RI.8.2

**Question:**
Which statement best describes how the central idea that Jim Bridger was a pioneering explorer of the American West develops throughout the text and relates to supporting ideas?

A. The text initially establishes Bridger as a young explorer, then develops this idea by showing how his early discoveries of natural landmarks led directly to his later success as a storyteller and entertainer for travelers.

*B. The text introduces Bridger as one of the first to explore western territories, then expands this central idea by detailing how his pioneering discoveries enabled him to become a successful trapper, trading post owner, and valued guide who helped others navigate the West.

C. The text presents Bridger's role as an explorer by focusing primarily on his discovery of the Great Salt Lake, then shifts to emphasize how this single achievement overshadowed his other contributions to western expansion.

D. The text establishes Bridger as an adventurous frontiersman, then develops this idea by explaining how his exploration skills declined over time, leading him to rely more on telling tall tales than on actual guiding work.

---

**Rationales:**

**Option A (Distractor):** Students selecting this option recognize that Bridger was an explorer and storyteller, but they misunderstand the relationship between these ideas. The text presents his storytelling as a separate, entertaining aspect of his personality rather than as a direct result of his discoveries. His tall tales were fictional exaggerations, not accounts of his actual explorations.

**Option B (Correct Answer):** This option correctly identifies how the central idea of Bridger as a pioneering explorer develops throughout the text. The passage begins with his early exploration experiences (Missouri River, Yellowstone), then shows how these foundational experiences led to multiple interconnected successes: his beaver trapping expertise, the establishment of Fort Bridger, his role as a guide, and his discovery of Bridger's Pass. Each supporting idea builds upon and reinforces his identity as a pioneering figure who helped open the West.

**Option C (Distractor):** Students choosing this option may focus too heavily on the Great Salt Lake discovery mentioned in paragraph 3, missing how the text actually develops multiple aspects of Bridger's exploration career throughout. The text doesn't suggest this discovery overshadowed other contributions; rather, it presents it as one of many important achievements.

**Option D (Distractor):** This option misreads the text's development entirely. The passage shows Bridger's skills improving and expanding over time, not declining. His twenty years as a guide came after his storytelling at Fort Bridger, and the text presents these as concurrent strengths rather than suggesting one replaced the other due to declining abilities.

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

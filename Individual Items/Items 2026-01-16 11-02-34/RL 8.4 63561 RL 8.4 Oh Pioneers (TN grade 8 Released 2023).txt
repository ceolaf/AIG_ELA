Passage: RL 8.4 Oh Pioneers (TN grade 8 Released 2023).txt

1. In paragraph 1, the town of Hanover is described as being “anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland” and “trying not to be blown away.” What is the effect of the word “anchored” in this description?

A. It suggests the town is safely protected from the wind, like a ship tied securely in a harbor.  
B. It emphasizes how small and fragile the town seems, as if it could be swept away despite trying to hold on.*  
C. It shows that the town is heavy and permanent, firmly fixed to the land.  
D. It explains that the town is physically chained to the prairie so it cannot move.

**Correct Answer: B***

### Rationales

**Option B (Key):**  
- The literal meaning of “anchored” is securely fastened, like a ship held in place.  
- However, the passage immediately says the town “was trying not to be blown away,” which creates tension with that literal meaning.  
- In this context, “anchored” is figurative: it makes the town seem like a small object clinging to the land while powerful winds threaten to push it away.  
- This choice recognizes the connotative effect: the word highlights the town’s vulnerability and struggle, shaping a tone of precariousness rather than safety.

**Option A (Distractor):**  
- This choice focuses only on the basic, denotative meaning of “anchored” (secure, safe), ignoring how the next phrase (“trying not to be blown away”) undercuts that sense of safety.  
- A reader who does not attend to the full sentence and tone might think “anchored” here simply means protected, but that misses the subtle contrast Cather creates.

**Option C (Distractor):**  
- This claims the town is “heavy and permanent,” but the passage later states, “None of them had any appearance of permanence,” directly contradicting this idea.  
- It misreads the figurative use of “anchored” by treating it as proof of lasting stability, instead of noticing that the rest of the description makes the town seem temporary and exposed.

**Option D (Distractor):**  
- This takes “anchored” in an overly literal, unrealistic way (“physically chained to the prairie”).  
- The text uses “anchored” metaphorically, not to describe actual chains or devices.  
- A reader choosing this has misunderstood the figurative nature of the word in this context.

Excerpt from O Pioneers!

by Willa Cather

One January day, thirty years ago, the little town of Hanover, anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland, was trying not to be blown away. A mist of fine snowflakes was curling and eddying about the cluster of low drab buildings huddled on the gray prairie, under a gray sky. The dwelling- houses were set about haphazard on the tough prairie sod; some of them looked as if they had been moved in overnight, and others as if they were straying off by themselves, headed straight for the open plain. None of them had any appearance of permanence, and the howling wind blew under them as well as over them. The main street was a deeply rutted road, now frozen hard, which ran from the squat red railway station and the grain “elevator” at the north end of the town to the lumber yard and the horse pond at the south end. On either side of this road straggled two uneven rows of wooden buildings; the general merchandise stores, the two banks, the drug store, the feed store, the saloon, the post- office. The board sidewalks were gray with trampled snow, but at two o’clock in the afternoon the shopkeepers, having come back from dinner, were keeping well behind their frosty windows. The children were all in school, and there was nobody abroad in the streets but a few rough- looking countrymen in coarse overcoats, with their long caps pulled down to their noses. Some of them had brought their wives to town, and now and then a red or a plaid shawl flashed out of one store into the shelter of another. At the hitch- bars along the street a few heavy work- horses, harnessed to farm wagons, shivered under their blankets. About the station everything was quiet, for there would not be another train in until night.

On the sidewalk in front of one of the stores sat a little Swede boy, crying bitterly. He was about five years old. His black cloth coat was much too big for him and made him look like a little old man. His shrunken brown flannel dress had been washed many times and left a long stretch of stocking between the hem of his skirt and the tops of his clumsy, copper- toed shoes. His cap was pulled down over his ears; his nose and his chubby cheeks were chapped and red with cold. He cried quietly, and the few people who hurried by did not notice him. He was afraid to stop any one, afraid to go into the store and ask for help, so he sat wringing his long sleeves and looking up a telegraph pole beside him, whimpering, “My kitten, oh, my kitten! Her will fweeze!” At the top of the pole crouched a shivering gray kitten, mewing faintly and clinging desperately to the wood with her claws. The boy had been left at the store while his sister went to the doctor’s office, and in her absence a dog had chased his kitten up the pole. The little creature had never been so high before, and she was too frightened to move. Her master was sunk in despair. He was a little country boy, and this village was to him a very strange and perplexing place, where people wore fine clothes and had hard hearts. He always felt shy and awkward here, and wanted to hide behind things for fear someone might laugh at him. Just now, he was too unhappy to care who laughed. At last he seemed to see a ray of hope: his sister was coming, and he got up and ran toward her in his heavy shoes.

His sister was a tall, strong girl, and she walked rapidly and resolutely, as if she knew exactly where she was going and what she was going to do next. She wore a man’s long ulster1 (not as if it were an affliction, but as if it were very comfortable and belonged to her; carried it like a young soldier), and a round plush cap, tied down with a thick veil. She had a serious, thoughtful face, and her clear, deep blue eyes were fixed intently on the distance, without seeming to see anything, as if she were in trouble. She did not notice the little boy until he pulled her by the coat. Then she stopped short and stooped down to wipe his wet face.

“Why, Emil! I told you to stay in the store and not to come out. What is the matter with you?”

“My kitten, sister, my kitten! A man put her out, and a dog chased her up there.” His forefinger, projecting from the sleeve of his coat, pointed up to the wretched little creature on the pole.

“Oh, Emil! Didn’t I tell you she’d get us into trouble of some kind, if you brought her? What made you tease me so? But there, I ought to have known better myself.” She went to the foot of the pole and held out her arms, crying, “Kitty, kitty, kitty,” but the kitten only mewed and faintly waved its tail. Alexandra turned away decidedly. “No, she won’t come down. Somebody will have to go up after her. I saw the Linstrums’ wagon in town. I’ll go and see if I can find Carl. Maybe he can do something. Only you must stop crying, or I won’t go a step. Where’s your comforter? Did you leave it in the store? Never mind. Hold still, till I put this on you.”

She unwound the brown veil from her head and tied it about his throat.

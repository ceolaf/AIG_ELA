Passage: RI 8.2 Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk (NJ grade 8 practice test).txt

Here is a unique multiple-choice item aligned to CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.8.2 based on the passage "Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk."

**Item Stem:**
In paragraph 1, the author introduces the central idea that elephants possess "higher social cognition." How does the detailed description of the experiment in paragraph 3 contribute to the development of this central idea?

**Answer Options:**
A. It emphasizes that elephants are superior to other species by noting that they learned the task faster than chimpanzees.
B. *It distinguishes true cooperation from simple learned behavior by showing that elephants waited for a partner before pulling.
C. It suggests that the elephants’ ability to cooperate is limited because they would give up if a partner’s rope was out of reach.
D. It indicates that the elephants were motivated primarily by the treats rather than by a genuine desire to help a partner.

**Rationales:**

*   **Option A:** This is a distractor. While paragraph 3 does state that elephants learned "faster than the chimpanzees," this comparison is a supporting detail. The main function of the paragraph is to prove the elephants understood the *mechanism* of cooperation (waiting), not simply to rank their speed against other animals.
*   **Option B:** This is the correct answer (*). The central idea of "higher social cognition" implies complex thinking. Paragraph 3 develops this by describing how elephants inhibited their actions (waiting) when a partner was delayed. This specific detail proves they understood the necessity of the partner, validating the claim that this is high-level cognition rather than just a trained trick.
*   **Option C:** This is a distractor. The text states that elephants gave up when the partner was essentially disabled (rope out of reach). In the context of the passage, this is presented as evidence of intelligence (understanding the task is impossible), not as a limitation or failure of cooperation.
*   **Option D:** This is a distractor. While the elephants were indeed working for corn (treats), the development of the central idea focuses on *how* they achieved the goal (cooperation/cognition). The motivation (food) is a constant in the experiment, but the cognitive breakthrough described in paragraph 3 is the coordination, not the appetite.

**LBIDAT Evaluation**

*Stem & Task*
**✓** No Apparent Critical Issues.
The stem explicitly references the standard (RI.8.2) by asking the student to analyze how a specific portion of the text (paragraph 3) contributes to the development of the central idea established in the introduction.

*The Key*
**✓** No Apparent Critical Issues.
The key correctly identifies the function of the evidence in paragraph 3. It explains the relationship between the experimental behavior (waiting) and the abstract concept (social cognition).

*Distractors*
**✓** No Apparent Critical Issues.
The distractors are plausible interpretations of the text but fail to correctly analyze the structural development.
- Distractor A focuses on the comparison detail rather than the cognitive proof.
- Distractor B interprets a sign of intelligence (knowing when to quit) as a negative limitation.
- Distractor C confuses the motivation for the action with the cognitive development of the central idea.

*Stimulus*
**✓** No Apparent Critical Issues.
The stimulus supports the item well, offering clear structural shifts (Introduction of idea -> Method -> Proof of complexity -> External validation) that allow for deep analysis.

*Fairness*
**✓** No Apparent Critical Issues.
The item is free of bias or sensitivity issues.

Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk
by Virginia Morell 


Elephants know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk. That’s the conclusion of a new study that tested the cooperative skills of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand and showed that the pachyderms understand that they will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance. The ability to recognize that you sometimes need a little help from your friends is a sign of higher social cognition, psychologists say, and is rarely found in other species. Elephants now join an elite club of social cooperators: chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.

To test the elephants’ cooperation skills, a team of scientists modified a classic experiment first administered to chimpanzees in the 1930s, which requires two animals work together to earn a treat. If they don’t cooperate, neither gets the reward. For the elephants, the researchers used a sliding table with a single rope threaded around it. Two bowls of corn were attached to the table, but the elephants could reach them only by pulling two ends of the rope simultaneously. Working with mahout—Asian elephant trainers—trained elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, the researchers first taught individual animals to pull the rope with their trunks. The 12 elephants were then divided into six pairs, and each pair was released to walk to their waiting ropes. If one animal pulled the rope before the other, the rope would slip out, leaving the table—and treats—in place. “That taught them to pull together,” says Joshua Plotnik, a postdoc in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the lead author of the study, which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To find out if the elephants understood that they needed one another’s assistance, the researchers upped the challenge by releasing the elephants at different times. Thus, one elephant would arrive at the table before the other and would have to wait for a partner to show up before pulling the rope. “They learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” says Plotnik. “They would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting.” In another experiment, the partner’s rope was placed out of reach. “When the partner couldn’t do anything, the other one would just give up,” Plotnik says. That shows the elephants understood why the partner was needed, he adds.

“These are clever experiments,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who studies social cognition in wild elephants. The findings are consistent with observations in nature, she says. For instance, in East Africa biologists have seen elephants work together to lift a fallen companion with their tusks. “It’s particularly striking that the elephants were able to inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees do, comparative psychologist Nicola Clayton of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She and her team showed that rooks, too, could pass a similar dual-rope exam, although they failed to wait. The study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”

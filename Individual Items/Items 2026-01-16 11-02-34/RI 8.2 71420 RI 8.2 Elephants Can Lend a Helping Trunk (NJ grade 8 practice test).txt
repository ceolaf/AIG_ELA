Passage: RI 8.2 Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk (NJ grade 8 practice test).txt

Based on the passage "Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk," here is another multiple choice item aligned to RI.8.2:

**Which statement best describes how the central idea about elephants' social cognition develops through its relationship to supporting ideas in the text?**

A. The central idea that elephants cooperate is initially supported by anecdotal evidence from trainers, then challenged by experimental failures, before being confirmed through observations of wild elephant behavior.

*B. The central idea that elephants understand the need for cooperation is first presented as a research conclusion, then substantiated through progressively complex experimental tasks, and finally contextualized by comparing elephants' performance to other species and natural behaviors.

C. The central idea that elephants are intelligent emerges through descriptions of their physical abilities, expands to include their problem-solving skills, and culminates in proving they surpass all other animals in cooperation.

D. The central idea that elephants can be trained develops from simple rope-pulling exercises to complex partner tasks, with supporting evidence focusing primarily on the mahouts' training techniques and the rewards used.

**Rationales:**

**Option A (Incorrect):** This misrepresents the text's development. The passage doesn't begin with anecdotal evidence from trainers or describe experimental failures. The experiments were successful, and wild observations come at the end as supporting evidence, not as the primary confirmation.

**Option B (Correct):** This accurately captures the development pattern:
- The text opens with the research conclusion about elephants recognizing when they need help
- The middle sections detail experiments of increasing complexity (individual rope pulling → simultaneous pulling → delayed release → rope out of reach)
- The conclusion places findings in context through comparisons with chimpanzees, rooks, and hyenas, plus natural observations

**Option C (Incorrect):** While this presents a logical progression, it doesn't match the text. The passage doesn't start with physical abilities or claim elephants surpass all other animals. The text actually shows elephants joining other species as cooperative problem-solvers, not exceeding them all.

**Option D (Incorrect):** This distractor focuses on training as the central idea, when training is merely the method used to test cooperation. The mahouts and rewards are minor supporting details, not central to how the main idea develops. This misidentifies the central idea entirely.

Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk
by Virginia Morell 


Elephants know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk. That’s the conclusion of a new study that tested the cooperative skills of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand and showed that the pachyderms understand that they will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance. The ability to recognize that you sometimes need a little help from your friends is a sign of higher social cognition, psychologists say, and is rarely found in other species. Elephants now join an elite club of social cooperators: chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.

To test the elephants’ cooperation skills, a team of scientists modified a classic experiment first administered to chimpanzees in the 1930s, which requires two animals work together to earn a treat. If they don’t cooperate, neither gets the reward. For the elephants, the researchers used a sliding table with a single rope threaded around it. Two bowls of corn were attached to the table, but the elephants could reach them only by pulling two ends of the rope simultaneously. Working with mahout—Asian elephant trainers—trained elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, the researchers first taught individual animals to pull the rope with their trunks. The 12 elephants were then divided into six pairs, and each pair was released to walk to their waiting ropes. If one animal pulled the rope before the other, the rope would slip out, leaving the table—and treats—in place. “That taught them to pull together,” says Joshua Plotnik, a postdoc in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the lead author of the study, which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To find out if the elephants understood that they needed one another’s assistance, the researchers upped the challenge by releasing the elephants at different times. Thus, one elephant would arrive at the table before the other and would have to wait for a partner to show up before pulling the rope. “They learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” says Plotnik. “They would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting.” In another experiment, the partner’s rope was placed out of reach. “When the partner couldn’t do anything, the other one would just give up,” Plotnik says. That shows the elephants understood why the partner was needed, he adds.

“These are clever experiments,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who studies social cognition in wild elephants. The findings are consistent with observations in nature, she says. For instance, in East Africa biologists have seen elephants work together to lift a fallen companion with their tusks. “It’s particularly striking that the elephants were able to inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees do, comparative psychologist Nicola Clayton of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She and her team showed that rooks, too, could pass a similar dual-rope exam, although they failed to wait. The study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”

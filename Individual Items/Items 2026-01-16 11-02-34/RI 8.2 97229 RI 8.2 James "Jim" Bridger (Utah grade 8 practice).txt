Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

## Multiple Choice Item for RI.8.2

**Question:** How does the text develop the central idea of Bridger's contributions to westward expansion, and how do supporting ideas relate to this development?

A. The central idea of Bridger's contributions to westward expansion emerges midway through the text with Fort Bridger serving travelers, then expands backward to explain his early explorations, and finally demonstrates how his storytelling attracted more settlers to move west.

B. The central idea of Bridger's impact on westward expansion is established through his beaver trapping business, which depleted animal populations and forced him to find new careers, ultimately leading him to discover shortcuts that helped other settlers.

C. *The central idea of Bridger's contributions to westward expansion develops progressively from his early exploration and mapping work, builds through establishing Fort Bridger as a supply point on the Oregon Trail, and reaches its peak with his discovery of Bridger's Pass, which shortened journeys and later became part of the Transcontinental Railroad.

D. The central idea of Bridger's role in westward expansion begins strongly with his discovery of major landmarks, but diminishes over time as the text reveals he may not have been first to discover the Great Salt Lake and concludes with his quiet retirement to farming.

### Rationales:

**Option A (Incorrect):** This mischaracterizes the text's chronological development. The text presents Bridger's life and contributions in a largely chronological order, not "backward" as this option suggests. Additionally, there's no evidence in the text that his storytelling attracted settlers—it entertained those already traveling west.

**Option B (Incorrect):** This creates a false cause-and-effect relationship not present in the text. The passage never suggests that beaver trapping depleted animal populations or forced Bridger to find new careers. This misreads the relationship between his various roles and accomplishments.

**Option C (Correct):** This accurately traces how the central idea develops through three progressive stages: early exploration work (providing foundational knowledge) → Fort Bridger (direct support to westward travelers) → Bridger's Pass (lasting infrastructure contribution). Each stage shows an increasing level of impact on westward expansion, with supporting details about his skills and knowledge connecting these achievements.

**Option D (Incorrect):** This mischaracterizes the development as "diminishing" when the text actually builds toward Bridger's most significant contribution (Bridger's Pass). The uncertainty about the Great Salt Lake discovery is a minor detail that doesn't diminish the central idea, and his retirement is simply a biographical conclusion, not a diminishment of his contributions.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

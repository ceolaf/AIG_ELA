Passage: RI 8.2 Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk (NJ grade 8 practice test).txt

I'll create a multiple choice item aligned to RI.8.2 that focuses on determining and analyzing the development of a central idea throughout the text.

**Draft Item:**

How does the central idea that elephants demonstrate advanced social cognition develop throughout the passage?

A. The passage begins by stating elephants need help, then describes failed experiments, and concludes that more research is needed to understand elephant intelligence.

B. The passage introduces the concept through a research conclusion, then details increasingly complex experiments that demonstrate elephants' cooperative abilities, and finally validates these findings through expert opinions and natural observations.

C. The passage starts with observations of elephants in the wild, moves to laboratory testing that contradicts these observations, and ends by questioning whether elephants truly understand cooperation.

D. The passage opens with a comparison to chimpanzees, explains why elephants are inferior to other species, then reverses this position based on new evidence from Thailand.

**Answer Key:** B*

**Rationales:**

**Option A (Distractor):** A student might select this if they misread the opening statement about elephants knowing when they need help as meaning the elephants themselves need help, rather than understanding it's about recognizing when cooperation is needed. This also incorrectly states the experiments failed and misrepresents the conclusion.

**Option B (Key):** This correctly traces how the central idea develops: 
1. Opens with the research conclusion that elephants understand cooperation
2. Describes the rope-pulling experiments that become progressively more challenging
3. Concludes with expert validation and examples from nature that support the findings

**Option C (Distractor):** Students might choose this if they confuse the order of information or misunderstand that the natural observations support rather than contradict the experimental findings. This reverses the actual structure of the passage.

**Option D (Distractor):** This might appeal to students who notice the chimpanzee comparison but misunderstand that elephants actually performed better than chimpanzees in waiting tasks. It also incorrectly suggests the passage reverses its position.

**LBIDAT Analysis:**

- **Stem & Task:** ✓ (Appropriately targets RI.8.2 by asking about central idea development)
- **The Key:** ✓ (Definitively correct and directly responsive)
- **Distractors:** ✓ (Each represents a plausible misreading or misconception)
- **Stimulus:** ✓ (Passage is necessary to answer correctly)
- **Fairness:** ✓ (No sensitivity issues)

**Final Version:**

How does the central idea that elephants demonstrate advanced social cognition develop throughout the passage?

A. The passage begins by stating elephants need help, then describes failed experiments, and concludes that more research is needed to understand elephant intelligence.

*B. The passage introduces the concept through a research conclusion, then details increasingly complex experiments that demonstrate elephants' cooperative abilities, and finally validates these findings through expert opinions and natural observations.

C. The passage starts with observations of elephants in the wild, moves to laboratory testing that contradicts these observations, and ends by questioning whether elephants truly understand cooperation.

Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk
by Virginia Morell 


Elephants know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk. That’s the conclusion of a new study that tested the cooperative skills of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand and showed that the pachyderms understand that they will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance. The ability to recognize that you sometimes need a little help from your friends is a sign of higher social cognition, psychologists say, and is rarely found in other species. Elephants now join an elite club of social cooperators: chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.

To test the elephants’ cooperation skills, a team of scientists modified a classic experiment first administered to chimpanzees in the 1930s, which requires two animals work together to earn a treat. If they don’t cooperate, neither gets the reward. For the elephants, the researchers used a sliding table with a single rope threaded around it. Two bowls of corn were attached to the table, but the elephants could reach them only by pulling two ends of the rope simultaneously. Working with mahout—Asian elephant trainers—trained elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, the researchers first taught individual animals to pull the rope with their trunks. The 12 elephants were then divided into six pairs, and each pair was released to walk to their waiting ropes. If one animal pulled the rope before the other, the rope would slip out, leaving the table—and treats—in place. “That taught them to pull together,” says Joshua Plotnik, a postdoc in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the lead author of the study, which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To find out if the elephants understood that they needed one another’s assistance, the researchers upped the challenge by releasing the elephants at different times. Thus, one elephant would arrive at the table before the other and would have to wait for a partner to show up before pulling the rope. “They learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” says Plotnik. “They would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting.” In another experiment, the partner’s rope was placed out of reach. “When the partner couldn’t do anything, the other one would just give up,” Plotnik says. That shows the elephants understood why the partner was needed, he adds.

“These are clever experiments,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who studies social cognition in wild elephants. The findings are consistent with observations in nature, she says. For instance, in East Africa biologists have seen elephants work together to lift a fallen companion with their tusks. “It’s particularly striking that the elephants were able to inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees do, comparative psychologist Nicola Clayton of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She and her team showed that rooks, too, could pass a similar dual-rope exam, although they failed to wait. The study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”

**Item Draft**

**Stem:**
Which statement provides the best objective summary of the passage?

A. Jim Bridger was a blacksmith who later became famous for telling tall tales about petrified birds to settlers stopping at his fort.
B. Jim Bridger made a living trapping beaver for pelts until the industry changed, forcing him to open a fort to sell supplies to travelers.
C. Jim Bridger was a skilled outdoorsman who explored the western frontier, established a trading post, and identified routes that aided American settlement.*
D. Jim Bridger single-handedly discovered the Great Salt Lake and Yellowstone National Park, proving he was the greatest explorer of the nineteenth century.

**Rationales:**

*   **A (Distractor):** This option is incorrect. It focuses on minor details (his early job as a blacksmith and the specific content of his stories) while omitting his significant contributions to exploration and western expansion, which are central to the text.
*   **B (Distractor):** This option is incorrect. It focuses only on the middle portion of the text (the transition from trapping to the fort). It ignores his earlier explorations and his later work as a guide and the discovery of Bridger’s Pass.
*   **C (Key):** This option is correct. It synthesizes the major elements of the text: his role as an explorer (Yellowstone/Salt Lake), his business venture (Fort Bridger), and his lasting impact on migration (Bridger’s Pass/guiding). It remains objective and covers the text chronologically.
*   **D (Distractor):** This option is incorrect. It violates the requirement for an "objective" summary by using subjective language ("greatest explorer"). It also contains factual inaccuracies based on the text, which states that Etienne Provost may have seen the Great Salt Lake before Bridger.

**LBIDAT Evaluation**

*   **Stem & Task (✓):** The stem aligns directly with the second half of RI.8.2 ("provide an objective summary of the text"). It asks students to distinguish between minor details, partial summaries, and a comprehensive summary.
*   **The Key (✓):** The key is definitively correct. It captures the main idea (Bridger's life and importance) and touches on the beginning, middle, and end of the passage without including opinion.
*   **Distractors (✓):**
    *   Distractor A appeals to students who focus on the most "interesting" details (the stories) rather than the main ideas.
    *   Distractor B is a "partial scope" error; the information is largely true but incomplete.
    *   Distractor D appeals to students who miss the nuance in the text regarding the discovery of the Salt Lake and who confuse subjective praise with objective summary.
*   **Stimulus (✓):** The text provides all necessary information. The chronological structure of the text supports a summary item well.
*   **Fairness (✓):** The content is historical and neutral. No sensitivity concerns.

================== Passage Text =================

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

Passage: RL 8.4 Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant (MN grade 8 2018).txt

I'll create a multiple choice item aligned to RL.8.4 that focuses on the impact of specific word choices on meaning and tone.

## Draft Item:

**Stem:**
In paragraph 4, the narrator states that she hoped "to find a motherly figure in Dr. Blackwell" but "was quickly disabused of that notion." How does the word choice "disabused" impact the tone of this statement?

A. It creates a formal, clinical tone that mirrors Dr. Blackwell's professional demeanor.*

B. It suggests a gentle correction that shows Dr. Blackwell's kindness.

C. It indicates the narrator's anger at being deceived by Dr. Blackwell.

D. It reveals the narrator's confusion about medical terminology.

## Rationales:

**A (Key):** The word "disabused" is a formal, sophisticated word choice that means to be freed from a false impression or misconception. This formal diction creates a tone that reflects the professional, no-nonsense atmosphere Dr. Blackwell maintains in her clinic. The narrator's use of this precise, clinical language mirrors the very quality she discovered in Dr. Blackwell—a professional demeanor rather than a maternal one. This word choice shows the narrator adopting the formal register appropriate to the medical setting.

**B:** A student might select this if they misunderstand the connotation of "disabused." While the word does mean to correct a misconception, it carries a sharp, decisive connotation rather than a gentle one. The context ("reprimanding me in front of all the other students") confirms that Dr. Blackwell's corrections are not gentle.

**C:** This distractor might appeal to students who recognize the negative experience but misinterpret the tone. While the narrator is disappointed, "disabused" doesn't convey anger or suggest intentional deception. The word indicates the narrator's false assumption was corrected, not that she was deliberately misled.

**D:** Students might choose this if they don't know the word "disabused" and assume it's medical jargon. However, "disabused" is not medical terminology but rather formal vocabulary that an educated person of the time period would use.

## LBIDAT Evaluation:

**Stem & Task:** ✓ - The task appropriately targets RL.8.4 by asking students to analyze how a specific word choice impacts tone. It requires understanding connotative meaning and the subtle effects of formal diction.

**The Key:** ✓ - The key is definitively correct and directly responsive to the question about how the word choice impacts tone.

**Distractors:** ✓ - Each distractor represents a plausible misunderstanding of either the word's meaning or its tonal impact, and each stems from different misconceptions about the word or context.

**Stimulus:** ✓ - The passage provides necessary context for understanding the word's impact, and students must reference the passage to answer correctly.

**Fairness:** ✓ - No inappropriate sensitivity issues are present.

## Final Version:

In paragraph 4, the narrator states that she hoped "to find a motherly figure in Dr. Blackwell" but "was quickly disabused of that notion." How does the word choice "disabused" impact the tone of this statement?

A. It creates a formal, clinical tone that mirrors Dr. Blackwell's professional demeanor.*

B. It suggests a gentle correction that shows Dr. Blackwell's kindness.

C. It indicates the narrator's anger at being deceived by Dr. Blackwell.

D. It reveals the narrator's confusion about medical terminology.

Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant

written for the Minnesota Department of Education

Elizabeth Blackwell was the first American woman to attend medical school. In 1857, unable to find work because of her gender, Dr. Blackwell opened her own clinic in New York, where her primary patients (and employees) were women. After the Civil War ended in 1865, she opened a medical school at the clinic to train other women to become doctors. The following is a fictional personal reflection written by a nurse who hopes to achieve this goal.

I was only a few days into my second week working under Miss . . . I mean, Dr. Blackwell, and already I felt that I could do nothing right.

Actually, my first mistake was not remembering to call her by her title. The idea of a woman doctor still required some adjustment, even though I harbored the hope of becoming one myself someday.

When I first heard of Elizabeth Blackwell and her accomplishments—the first American woman to be admitted to medical school, the first to become a doctor, the first to open her own clinic—she became my heroine. I saved as much money as I could from my nursing duties. When the war finally ended, I moved to New York and became one of her apprentices. My parents disapproved, of course; they thought I should return home and find a husband among the young men who survived the war. But after what I have seen and experienced at the battlefield, I know I can do more. I know that I am no longer satisfied with bandaging wounds and comforting the afflicted. I long to save lives, find cures for diseases, make the broken whole again. And now, someone has shown the world that women are as capable of accomplishing these deeds as any man.

However, my first week under Dr. Blackwell’s tutelage has, I fear, called my abilities into question. I was quite capable in my former role as a field nurse, but now I feel very self-conscious under her watchful eye. I either freeze like a statue or make all manner of clumsy blunders. If I was hoping to find a motherly figure in Dr. Blackwell, I was quickly disabused of that notion. On my very first day, when I failed to adequately prepare a tray of instruments, she thought nothing of reprimanding me in front of all the other students, nurses, and patients. Every day has brought at least one similar scolding. It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance.

I must somehow manage to do better, make no further mistakes, and gain the doctor’s respect, or she will send me away. That would extinguish my hopes, for the Women’s Medical College that Dr. Blackwell has founded here at the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children is the only institution of its kind.

This institution is sorely needed. Many women were made widows during the war. Others saw their husbands return to them so badly injured that they cannot possibly work. These women have little money for a doctor when they or their children become ill. Established doctors expect to be paid for their services. And so these less fortunate patients come to us.

I think the relief I see in these women’s faces, however, is based on more than financial concerns. Though the clinic accepts people who cannot pay, more than one young woman has communicated to me that she is more comfortable discussing her health problems with another woman than with a man. I am still not sure our patients are as confident in our abilities as they would be with those of a male doctor. Female physicians are still more of a curiosity than anything. These patients, however, cannot afford to doubt us.

Today I spoke soothingly to a nervous young woman who was in my charge, trying to calm her as I helped her onto the bed. The poor girl looked alarmed; her eyes darted back and forth, and her fingers trembled in my hands. She had obviously never been in a medical institution before.

 “Less chatter, please, Diana!” Dr. Blackwell snapped. “This is a hospital, not a place for idle conversation.” Once again, I felt unjustly reprimanded, like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar. As usual, I bit my tongue and said nothing. My patient forgot her fear for a moment and gave me a sympathetic look. That response only made me feel worse.

An industrial accident had occurred earlier in the day, so the night was unusually busy. I did not have the chance to stop and think but simply moved purposefully from one patient to the next, diagnosing problems and administering aid. Indeed, I was reminded of my time as a nurse on the battlefield during which rest was impossible to obtain.

Finally, the endless evening was finished. Only then did I turn to see Dr. Blackwell at my elbow. She had been assisting me all along, and I had not even acknowledged her. In fact, for the first time in almost two weeks, I had forgotten all about her. Now I was sure to be sent home.

But she was smiling at me.

“Well done, Diana!” she said. “Perhaps you will become a doctor after all.”

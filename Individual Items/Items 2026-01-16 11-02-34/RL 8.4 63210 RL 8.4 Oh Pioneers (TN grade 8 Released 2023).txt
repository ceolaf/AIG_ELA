Passage: RL 8.4 Oh Pioneers (TN grade 8 Released 2023).txt

Looking at this passage, I need to find a word or phrase that carries connotative meaning beyond its literal definition and impacts the tone of the text. Let me identify a strong candidate that meets the RL.8.4 standard requirements.

The word "anchored" in the opening line is particularly effective: "the little town of Hanover, anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland." This word choice creates irony and establishes the precarious nature of the town's existence.

Here's my item:

---

**Item:**

Read this sentence from the passage:

"One January day, thirty years ago, the little town of Hanover, **anchored** on a windy Nebraska tableland, was trying not to be blown away."

In this context, what is the impact of the author's use of the word "anchored"?

A. It emphasizes how firmly established and permanent the town has become over many years of settlement.

B. It suggests the town's location near water, which would have been important for early settlers.

*C. It creates irony by comparing the town to something secure while showing it is actually unstable and temporary.

D. It indicates that the town serves as a central meeting point that connects surrounding communities together.

**Rationales:**

**Option A:** This represents a misunderstanding of the connotative impact. While "anchored" literally means secured or fixed in place, the student selecting this option fails to recognize how the subsequent description ("trying not to be blown away," buildings with "no appearance of permanence") contradicts this literal meaning, missing the ironic tension the author creates.

**Option B:** This is a surface-level misinterpretation based on the most common association of "anchor" with boats and water. The student makes an incorrect inference about the denotative meaning rather than analyzing the word's connotative impact in this specific context about a prairie town.

**Option C (Key):** This correctly identifies how Cather uses "anchored" ironically. The word typically connotes security and permanence, but the immediate contrast with "trying not to be blown away" and the subsequent descriptions of impermanent, haphazard buildings creates a tension that emphasizes the town's vulnerability and temporary nature rather than its stability.

**Option D:** This represents a generic interpretation of "anchor" as a central point or hub, which doesn't account for the specific context of the passage. The student projects a meaning about community connections that isn't supported by the text's focus on physical instability and isolation.

Excerpt from O Pioneers!

by Willa Cather

One January day, thirty years ago, the little town of Hanover, anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland, was trying not to be blown away. A mist of fine snowflakes was curling and eddying about the cluster of low drab buildings huddled on the gray prairie, under a gray sky. The dwelling- houses were set about haphazard on the tough prairie sod; some of them looked as if they had been moved in overnight, and others as if they were straying off by themselves, headed straight for the open plain. None of them had any appearance of permanence, and the howling wind blew under them as well as over them. The main street was a deeply rutted road, now frozen hard, which ran from the squat red railway station and the grain “elevator” at the north end of the town to the lumber yard and the horse pond at the south end. On either side of this road straggled two uneven rows of wooden buildings; the general merchandise stores, the two banks, the drug store, the feed store, the saloon, the post- office. The board sidewalks were gray with trampled snow, but at two o’clock in the afternoon the shopkeepers, having come back from dinner, were keeping well behind their frosty windows. The children were all in school, and there was nobody abroad in the streets but a few rough- looking countrymen in coarse overcoats, with their long caps pulled down to their noses. Some of them had brought their wives to town, and now and then a red or a plaid shawl flashed out of one store into the shelter of another. At the hitch- bars along the street a few heavy work- horses, harnessed to farm wagons, shivered under their blankets. About the station everything was quiet, for there would not be another train in until night.

On the sidewalk in front of one of the stores sat a little Swede boy, crying bitterly. He was about five years old. His black cloth coat was much too big for him and made him look like a little old man. His shrunken brown flannel dress had been washed many times and left a long stretch of stocking between the hem of his skirt and the tops of his clumsy, copper- toed shoes. His cap was pulled down over his ears; his nose and his chubby cheeks were chapped and red with cold. He cried quietly, and the few people who hurried by did not notice him. He was afraid to stop any one, afraid to go into the store and ask for help, so he sat wringing his long sleeves and looking up a telegraph pole beside him, whimpering, “My kitten, oh, my kitten! Her will fweeze!” At the top of the pole crouched a shivering gray kitten, mewing faintly and clinging desperately to the wood with her claws. The boy had been left at the store while his sister went to the doctor’s office, and in her absence a dog had chased his kitten up the pole. The little creature had never been so high before, and she was too frightened to move. Her master was sunk in despair. He was a little country boy, and this village was to him a very strange and perplexing place, where people wore fine clothes and had hard hearts. He always felt shy and awkward here, and wanted to hide behind things for fear someone might laugh at him. Just now, he was too unhappy to care who laughed. At last he seemed to see a ray of hope: his sister was coming, and he got up and ran toward her in his heavy shoes.

His sister was a tall, strong girl, and she walked rapidly and resolutely, as if she knew exactly where she was going and what she was going to do next. She wore a man’s long ulster1 (not as if it were an affliction, but as if it were very comfortable and belonged to her; carried it like a young soldier), and a round plush cap, tied down with a thick veil. She had a serious, thoughtful face, and her clear, deep blue eyes were fixed intently on the distance, without seeming to see anything, as if she were in trouble. She did not notice the little boy until he pulled her by the coat. Then she stopped short and stooped down to wipe his wet face.

“Why, Emil! I told you to stay in the store and not to come out. What is the matter with you?”

“My kitten, sister, my kitten! A man put her out, and a dog chased her up there.” His forefinger, projecting from the sleeve of his coat, pointed up to the wretched little creature on the pole.

“Oh, Emil! Didn’t I tell you she’d get us into trouble of some kind, if you brought her? What made you tease me so? But there, I ought to have known better myself.” She went to the foot of the pole and held out her arms, crying, “Kitty, kitty, kitty,” but the kitten only mewed and faintly waved its tail. Alexandra turned away decidedly. “No, she won’t come down. Somebody will have to go up after her. I saw the Linstrums’ wagon in town. I’ll go and see if I can find Carl. Maybe he can do something. Only you must stop crying, or I won’t go a step. Where’s your comforter? Did you leave it in the store? Never mind. Hold still, till I put this on you.”

She unwound the brown veil from her head and tied it about his throat.

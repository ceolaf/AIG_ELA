Passage: RI 8.2 Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk (NJ grade 8 practice test).txt

Here is a unique multiple-choice item aligned to Common Core State Standard RI.8.2, designed for Grade 8.

**Standard:** RI.8.2: Determine a central idea of a text and analyze its development over the course of the text, including its relationship to supporting ideas; provide an objective summary of the text.

**Passage:** Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk

***

**Item:**

Which statement best analyzes how the author develops the central idea that elephants possess complex cognitive abilities?

A. By contrasting the elephants' ability to wait for a partner with the behavior of rooks and chimpanzees, the author emphasizes the elephants' superior patience and understanding.*
B. By detailing the steps mahouts use to train elephants, the author argues that cooperative behavior is a learned skill rather than a natural ability.
C. By describing the physical setup of the sliding table and rope, the author illustrates that elephants rely on their trunks more than their social skills to solve problems.
D. By listing the specific foods used as rewards, the author suggests that elephants are motivated primarily by hunger rather than a desire to help one another.

***

**Rationales:**

*   **A is correct (*).** This option correctly analyzes the development of the text. The author establishes the central idea (elephants have high social cognition) by comparing their performance in the "delayed release" trial to other species. The text notes that elephants learned to wait "faster than the chimpanzees" and that while rooks could pass the test, "they failed to wait." This comparison is the primary method used to highlight the specific nature of the elephants' intelligence.
*   **B is incorrect.** While the text mentions that mahouts helped train the elephants to pull the rope (Paragraph 2), the central idea is not that cooperation is *only* a learned skill. The text emphasizes that the *understanding* of the partner's role (demonstrated by waiting) is a sign of "higher social cognition" and compares it to wild behaviors, implying an innate capacity for cooperation, not just rote training.
*   **C is incorrect.** This option focuses on a physical detail (the trunks/table) rather than the central idea of cognition. The author describes the setup to explain the experiment, not to argue that physical traits are more important than social skills. The text explicitly states that the experiment tests "cooperative skills," not physical attributes.
*   **D is incorrect.** This option focuses on a supporting detail (corn rewards) but draws an incorrect conclusion about the central idea. While food was the incentive, the central idea focuses on the *method* the elephants used to get the food (cooperation and patience), not the hunger itself. The text argues that the behavior shows they understand "why the partner was needed," which goes beyond simple hunger motivation.

Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk
by Virginia Morell 


Elephants know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk. That’s the conclusion of a new study that tested the cooperative skills of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand and showed that the pachyderms understand that they will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance. The ability to recognize that you sometimes need a little help from your friends is a sign of higher social cognition, psychologists say, and is rarely found in other species. Elephants now join an elite club of social cooperators: chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.

To test the elephants’ cooperation skills, a team of scientists modified a classic experiment first administered to chimpanzees in the 1930s, which requires two animals work together to earn a treat. If they don’t cooperate, neither gets the reward. For the elephants, the researchers used a sliding table with a single rope threaded around it. Two bowls of corn were attached to the table, but the elephants could reach them only by pulling two ends of the rope simultaneously. Working with mahout—Asian elephant trainers—trained elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, the researchers first taught individual animals to pull the rope with their trunks. The 12 elephants were then divided into six pairs, and each pair was released to walk to their waiting ropes. If one animal pulled the rope before the other, the rope would slip out, leaving the table—and treats—in place. “That taught them to pull together,” says Joshua Plotnik, a postdoc in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the lead author of the study, which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To find out if the elephants understood that they needed one another’s assistance, the researchers upped the challenge by releasing the elephants at different times. Thus, one elephant would arrive at the table before the other and would have to wait for a partner to show up before pulling the rope. “They learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” says Plotnik. “They would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting.” In another experiment, the partner’s rope was placed out of reach. “When the partner couldn’t do anything, the other one would just give up,” Plotnik says. That shows the elephants understood why the partner was needed, he adds.

“These are clever experiments,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who studies social cognition in wild elephants. The findings are consistent with observations in nature, she says. For instance, in East Africa biologists have seen elephants work together to lift a fallen companion with their tusks. “It’s particularly striking that the elephants were able to inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees do, comparative psychologist Nicola Clayton of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She and her team showed that rooks, too, could pass a similar dual-rope exam, although they failed to wait. The study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”

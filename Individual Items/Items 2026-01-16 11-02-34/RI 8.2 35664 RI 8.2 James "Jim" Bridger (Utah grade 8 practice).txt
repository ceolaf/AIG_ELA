2. Which choice identifies a central idea of the passage and accurately describes how the author develops it?

A. The passage develops the idea that Jim Bridger’s storytelling was more important than his exploring by beginning with his early life and ending with a focus on his tall tales.  
B. The passage develops the idea that Jim Bridger helped shape western expansion by showing how his exploration, trading post, and discovery of a key mountain pass supported travelers and transportation across the West.*  
C. The passage develops the idea that Jim Bridger’s business success depended mainly on beaver pelts by tracing how trapping led directly to his fame and to places being named after him.  
D. The passage develops the idea that Jim Bridger’s discoveries were mostly accidents by emphasizing his mistake about the Great Salt Lake and repeating similar accidents throughout his life story.

**Correct Answer: B***

### Rationales

**Option B (Key):**  
- A central idea of the passage is that Jim Bridger played an important role in the expansion of the American West.  
- Early paragraphs describe his exploration of the Missouri River and Yellowstone, showing his role in discovering and mapping western lands.  
- The text then explains how his skills led to beaver trapping and to the founding of Fort Bridger, a trading post where settlers on the Oregon Trail stopped for supplies and repairs.  
- Later, it describes his work as a guide and his discovery of Bridger’s Pass, which shortened trips for settlers and later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad in the Transcontinental Railroad.  
- The conclusion notes that many western places are named in his honor, reinforcing his impact on western expansion.  
- This matches B’s description of a central idea and its development: exploration → trading post → key pass → lasting influence on westward travel and transportation.

**Option A (Distractor):**  
- Treats a supporting idea (his storytelling) as if it were the central idea.  
- The passage includes one section on his tall tales, but the beginning and ending focus on his life as an explorer, guide, and mountain man, not on storytelling as “more important.”  
- The passage does not “end with a focus on his tall tales”; it ends with his retirement, death, and legacy, so this mischaracterizes how the idea develops.

**Option C (Distractor):**  
- Misidentifies beaver trapping as the main central idea and invents a relationship that is not in the text.  
- Trapping is important for explaining how he gained success and helped justify Fort Bridger, but the passage does not say that trapping “led directly” to his fame and to places being named after him.  
- His wider exploration, guiding, and Bridger’s Pass are more clearly linked to his long-term importance.

**Option D (Distractor):**  
- Overstates the role of accidents and errors in the passage.  
- The text describes one notable mistake (thinking the Great Salt Lake was part of the Pacific), but it does not repeat similar accidents or present his discoveries as “mostly accidents.”  
- Most of the passage emphasizes his skills, knowledge, and deliberate contributions, so this misreads both the central idea and its development.

================== Passage Text =================

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

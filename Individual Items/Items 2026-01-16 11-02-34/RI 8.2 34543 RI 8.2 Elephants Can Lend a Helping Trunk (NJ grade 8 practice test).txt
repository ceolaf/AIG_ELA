Passage: RI 8.2 Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk (NJ grade 8 practice test).txt

Looking at this passage and the RI.8.2 standard, I need to create an item that tests students' ability to identify a central idea and analyze how it develops through its relationship to supporting ideas.

Let me first identify the central idea and supporting ideas in the passage:
- **Central idea**: Elephants demonstrate higher social cognition through their ability to understand when they need cooperative assistance
- **Supporting ideas**: 
  - Description of the modified experiment and its requirements
  - Evidence of elephants learning to wait for partners
  - Comparison to other species (chimpanzees, rooks)
  - Expert validation and natural observations

Here's my item:

---

**Which statement best describes how the central idea about elephants' cooperative abilities develops throughout the passage?**

A. The passage begins by stating elephants can cooperate, then provides experimental evidence showing they understand the need for assistance, and concludes with expert validation that confirms these abilities reflect higher social cognition.

*B. The passage introduces the concept of elephants recognizing when they need help, details experiments that test this ability through increasingly complex challenges, and reinforces the findings by comparing elephants' performance to other intelligent species.

C. The passage opens with a claim about elephant intelligence, describes a single experiment that proves cooperation, and ends by listing all the animals that share this trait with elephants.

D. The passage starts with observations of elephants in nature, moves to laboratory experiments that attempt to replicate these behaviors, and concludes that elephants are more intelligent than chimpanzees.

---

**Rationales:**

**Option A:** While this option correctly identifies some elements of the passage structure, it misses the key developmental aspect of how the experiments became increasingly challenging (first teaching basic rope pulling, then simultaneous pulling, then staggered release times, then making one rope unreachable). The "expert validation" is present but not the primary way the central idea develops.

**Option B (Key):** This correctly captures how the central idea develops: 
1. Introduction establishes that elephants understand when they need help (paragraph 1)
2. The experiments progressively test this understanding through increasing complexity (paragraphs 2-3)
3. The comparisons to other species throughout reinforce the significance of the findings (paragraphs 1, 3, and 4)

**Option C:** This oversimplifies the passage structure by suggesting only a "single experiment" when multiple experimental variations are described. It also incorrectly suggests the passage "ends" with a list of animals, when this actually appears in the first paragraph and is referenced throughout.

**Option D:** This reverses the actual structure of the passage. The passage begins with the experimental findings and only briefly mentions natural observations near the end as supporting evidence. Additionally, the passage doesn't conclude that elephants are "more intelligent" than chimpanzees, only that they learned certain tasks faster.

**LBIDAT Analysis:**

- **Stem & Task:** ✓ - Directly aligned to RI.8.2, asking about central idea development
- **The Key:** ✓ - Definitively correct and directly responsive
- **Distractors:** ✓ - Each represents a plausible misreading of the passage structure
- **Stimulus:** ✓ - Passage is grade-appropriate and necessary for the task
- **Fairness:** ✓ - No sensitivity issues

**Final Version:**

Which statement best describes how the central idea about elephants' cooperative abilities develops throughout the passage?

C. The passage opens with a claim about elephant intelligence, describes a single experiment that proves cooperation, and ends by listing all the animals that share this trait with elephants.

D. The passage starts with observations of elephants in nature, moves to laboratory experiments that attempt to replicate these behaviors, and concludes that elephants are more intelligent than chimpanzees.

Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk
by Virginia Morell 


Elephants know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk. That’s the conclusion of a new study that tested the cooperative skills of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand and showed that the pachyderms understand that they will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance. The ability to recognize that you sometimes need a little help from your friends is a sign of higher social cognition, psychologists say, and is rarely found in other species. Elephants now join an elite club of social cooperators: chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.

To test the elephants’ cooperation skills, a team of scientists modified a classic experiment first administered to chimpanzees in the 1930s, which requires two animals work together to earn a treat. If they don’t cooperate, neither gets the reward. For the elephants, the researchers used a sliding table with a single rope threaded around it. Two bowls of corn were attached to the table, but the elephants could reach them only by pulling two ends of the rope simultaneously. Working with mahout—Asian elephant trainers—trained elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, the researchers first taught individual animals to pull the rope with their trunks. The 12 elephants were then divided into six pairs, and each pair was released to walk to their waiting ropes. If one animal pulled the rope before the other, the rope would slip out, leaving the table—and treats—in place. “That taught them to pull together,” says Joshua Plotnik, a postdoc in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the lead author of the study, which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To find out if the elephants understood that they needed one another’s assistance, the researchers upped the challenge by releasing the elephants at different times. Thus, one elephant would arrive at the table before the other and would have to wait for a partner to show up before pulling the rope. “They learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” says Plotnik. “They would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting.” In another experiment, the partner’s rope was placed out of reach. “When the partner couldn’t do anything, the other one would just give up,” Plotnik says. That shows the elephants understood why the partner was needed, he adds.

“These are clever experiments,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who studies social cognition in wild elephants. The findings are consistent with observations in nature, she says. For instance, in East Africa biologists have seen elephants work together to lift a fallen companion with their tusks. “It’s particularly striking that the elephants were able to inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees do, comparative psychologist Nicola Clayton of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She and her team showed that rooks, too, could pass a similar dual-rope exam, although they failed to wait. The study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”

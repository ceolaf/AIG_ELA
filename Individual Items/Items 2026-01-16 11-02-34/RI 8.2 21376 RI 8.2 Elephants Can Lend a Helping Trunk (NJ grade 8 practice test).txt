Passage: RI 8.2 Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk (NJ grade 8 practice test).txt

Item (RI.8.2 – central idea and its development)

Which statement best explains how a central idea of the passage develops over the course of the text?

A. The passage begins by claiming that elephants are rare animals and then shows how their population numbers improve when they are trained to cooperate.  
B.* The passage introduces the idea that elephants have advanced social cooperation and then develops it by describing experiments and natural observations that support this idea.  
C. The passage starts with the idea that elephants are similar to chimpanzees and then changes its focus to show that elephants are actually less intelligent than other animals.  
D. The passage introduces the idea that elephants can be easily trained by humans and then proves it by explaining how mahouts control elephants in conservation centers.

Rationales

A. The passage begins by claiming that elephants are rare animals and then shows how their population numbers improve when they are trained to cooperate.  
- Misreads the central idea and its development.  
- The opening paragraph focuses on elephants’ cooperative skills and higher social cognition, not on their rarity or population numbers.  
- Nowhere does the passage discuss population changes or conservation outcomes based on training, so this does not accurately describe how an idea develops.

B.* The passage introduces the idea that elephants have advanced social cooperation and then develops it by describing experiments and natural observations that support this idea.  
- Correct.  
- Central idea: Elephants possess sophisticated social cooperation and understanding (introduced in paragraph 1: they “know when they need a helping hand” and join an “elite club of social cooperators”).  
- Development:  
  • Paragraphs 2–3: Detailed description of rope-pulling experiments showing elephants recognize when they need a partner and adjust their behavior (waiting, giving up when a partner can’t help).  
  • Final paragraph: Expert commentary and field observations (lifting a fallen companion, comparisons to chimps and rooks) that reinforce and extend the central idea.  
- This option accurately captures both the main idea and how supporting ideas (experiments and observations) build it.

C. The passage starts with the idea that elephants are similar to chimpanzees and then changes its focus to show that elephants are actually less intelligent than other animals.  
- Mischaracterizes both the central idea and its development.  
- The passage does compare elephants to chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans, but as fellow “social cooperators,” not to argue that elephants are less intelligent.  
- Later evidence (faster learning than chimpanzees, impressive inhibition) actually portrays elephants as cognitively impressive, so this reverses the direction of the development.

D. The passage introduces the idea that elephants can be easily trained by humans and then proves it by explaining how mahouts control elephants in conservation centers.  
- Mistakes a supporting detail (mahouts helping train elephants to pull the rope) for a central idea.  
- The training context is only used to set up the cooperation experiments; the passage does not develop an argument about trainability or human control.  
- This does not describe the main line of development of ideas across the text.

Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk
by Virginia Morell 


Elephants know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk. That’s the conclusion of a new study that tested the cooperative skills of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand and showed that the pachyderms understand that they will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance. The ability to recognize that you sometimes need a little help from your friends is a sign of higher social cognition, psychologists say, and is rarely found in other species. Elephants now join an elite club of social cooperators: chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.

To test the elephants’ cooperation skills, a team of scientists modified a classic experiment first administered to chimpanzees in the 1930s, which requires two animals work together to earn a treat. If they don’t cooperate, neither gets the reward. For the elephants, the researchers used a sliding table with a single rope threaded around it. Two bowls of corn were attached to the table, but the elephants could reach them only by pulling two ends of the rope simultaneously. Working with mahout—Asian elephant trainers—trained elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, the researchers first taught individual animals to pull the rope with their trunks. The 12 elephants were then divided into six pairs, and each pair was released to walk to their waiting ropes. If one animal pulled the rope before the other, the rope would slip out, leaving the table—and treats—in place. “That taught them to pull together,” says Joshua Plotnik, a postdoc in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the lead author of the study, which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To find out if the elephants understood that they needed one another’s assistance, the researchers upped the challenge by releasing the elephants at different times. Thus, one elephant would arrive at the table before the other and would have to wait for a partner to show up before pulling the rope. “They learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” says Plotnik. “They would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting.” In another experiment, the partner’s rope was placed out of reach. “When the partner couldn’t do anything, the other one would just give up,” Plotnik says. That shows the elephants understood why the partner was needed, he adds.

“These are clever experiments,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who studies social cognition in wild elephants. The findings are consistent with observations in nature, she says. For instance, in East Africa biologists have seen elephants work together to lift a fallen companion with their tusks. “It’s particularly striking that the elephants were able to inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees do, comparative psychologist Nicola Clayton of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She and her team showed that rooks, too, could pass a similar dual-rope exam, although they failed to wait. The study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”

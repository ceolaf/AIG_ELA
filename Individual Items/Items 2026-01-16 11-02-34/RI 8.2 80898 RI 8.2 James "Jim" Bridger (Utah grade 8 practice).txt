Here is a second unique multiple-choice item for 8th-grade students, aligned to CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.8.2.

**Item ID:** RI.8.2-Bridger-02
**Standard:** RI.8.2 Determine a central idea of a text and analyze its development over the course of the text, including its relationship to supporting ideas...
**Depth of Knowledge:** 2 (Skill/Concept)

**Item Stem:**
A central idea of the text is that Jim Bridger used his deep knowledge of the wilderness to adapt to the changing needs of the American frontier.

Which analysis best explains how the author develops this idea?

**Answer Options:**

A. By comparing Bridger’s early life in Virginia with his later retirement in Missouri to show that he never truly enjoyed living in the wilderness.

B. By highlighting Bridger’s "tall tales" to demonstrate that his fame was based more on his imagination than on his actual skills as a woodsman.

C. By focusing on the dispute over the discovery of the Great Salt Lake to show that Bridger’s contributions were often exaggerated by historians.

*D. By detailing Bridger’s transition from trapping beavers to establishing a trading post and eventually finding a pass for the railroad.

**Rationales:**

*   **Option A is incorrect.** This option misinterprets the text. While the text mentions his birth in Virginia and death in Missouri, the development of the text focuses heavily on his active years in the mountains. The text provides no evidence that he did not enjoy the wilderness; in fact, it states he spent twenty years as a guide and many years hiking.
*   **Option B is incorrect.** This option focuses on a specific supporting idea (his storytelling) but analyzes it incorrectly in relation to the central idea. The text states he is remembered for being *both* a skilled mountain man and a storyteller, not that the stories were more important than his skills. This ignores the sections regarding his work as a guide and explorer.
*   **Option C is incorrect.** This option focuses on a minor supporting detail found in paragraph 3. While the text mentions the dispute regarding Etienne Provost, this is a specific historical detail and does not represent the development of the central idea across the text as a whole.
*   **Option D is correct.** This option correctly analyzes the relationship between the central idea (adaptation to the changing frontier) and the supporting ideas arranged in the text. The author structures the text to show how Bridger’s initial skills in trapping (paragraph 4) led to the founding of Fort Bridger for settlers (paragraph 5) and eventually to his role as a guide for the railroad (paragraph 8).

================== Passage Text =================

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

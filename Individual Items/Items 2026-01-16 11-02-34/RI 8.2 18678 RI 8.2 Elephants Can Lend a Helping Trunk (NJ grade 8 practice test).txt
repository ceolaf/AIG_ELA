Passage: RI 8.2 Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk (NJ grade 8 practice test).txt

Looking at the passage again for a different approach to RI.8.2, I'll create an item that examines a different aspect of how central and supporting ideas interact and develop.

## Draft Item:

**How does the text develop its central idea about the significance of elephants' cooperative abilities, and how do supporting ideas contribute to this development?**

A. The text establishes that cooperation is a rare cognitive ability, then proves elephants possess it through experimental trials, with each new experimental variation serving to eliminate alternative explanations for the elephants' behavior until only true understanding remains.

B. The text focuses on describing a single groundbreaking study in detail, using quotes from researchers to explain the methodology, then briefly mentions that these findings match what happens in nature, suggesting the experiments were well-designed.

*C. The text positions elephant cooperation as evidence of "higher social cognition," develops this through progressively challenging experimental tasks that reveal understanding rather than mere training, and strengthens this claim by connecting the findings to expert perspectives and parallel examples from both wild elephants and other species.

D. The text argues that elephants are more intelligent than previously thought, supports this by showing they perform better than chimpanzees at cooperation tasks, and concludes by listing all the cognitive abilities elephants have demonstrated to build a comprehensive case for their intelligence.

## Rationales:

**Option A (Distractor):** While the text does show cooperation is rare and uses experimental variations, it doesn't frame these variations as systematically eliminating alternative explanations. Students might choose this if they recognize the experimental progression but impose a more scientific methodology framework than the text actually presents. The text is more about demonstrating different aspects of understanding than elimination of alternatives.

**Option B (Distractor):** This understates the text's scope and misrepresents the role of supporting ideas. The text describes multiple experimental variations (not just one study), and the researcher quotes do more than explain methodology—they interpret significance. Students might select this if they see the experiment as the main content but miss how it serves the larger argument about cognition.

**Option C (Key):** This correctly identifies how the central idea (cooperative abilities as evidence of higher social cognition) is established in the opening, developed through experimental evidence that specifically tests for understanding (waiting for partners, recognizing when cooperation is impossible), and reinforced through multiple supporting elements: expert validation (McComb, Clayton), natural observations (helping fallen elephants), and comparative context (other species with this ability).

**Option D (Distractor):** This misidentifies the central idea as being about general intelligence rather than specifically about cooperation as higher social cognition. While the text mentions elephants outperforming chimpanzees in one aspect, this isn't the organizing principle. The conclusion doesn't list various cognitive abilities—it stays focused on cooperation. Students might choose this if they conflate cooperation with general intelligence.

## Final Version:

**How does the text develop its central idea about the significance of elephants' cooperative abilities, and how do supporting ideas contribute to this development?**

A. The text establishes that cooperation is a rare cognitive ability, then proves elephants possess it through experimental trials, with each new experimental variation serving to eliminate alternative explanations for the elephants' behavior until only true understanding remains.

B. The text focuses on describing a single groundbreaking study in detail, using quotes from researchers to explain the methodology, then briefly mentions that these findings match what happens in nature, suggesting the experiments were well-designed.

*C.

D. The text argues that elephants are more intelligent than previously thought, supports this by showing they perform better than chimpanzees at cooperation tasks, and concludes by listing all the cognitive abilities elephants have demonstrated to build a comprehensive case for their intelligence.

Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk
by Virginia Morell 


Elephants know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk. That’s the conclusion of a new study that tested the cooperative skills of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand and showed that the pachyderms understand that they will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance. The ability to recognize that you sometimes need a little help from your friends is a sign of higher social cognition, psychologists say, and is rarely found in other species. Elephants now join an elite club of social cooperators: chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.

To test the elephants’ cooperation skills, a team of scientists modified a classic experiment first administered to chimpanzees in the 1930s, which requires two animals work together to earn a treat. If they don’t cooperate, neither gets the reward. For the elephants, the researchers used a sliding table with a single rope threaded around it. Two bowls of corn were attached to the table, but the elephants could reach them only by pulling two ends of the rope simultaneously. Working with mahout—Asian elephant trainers—trained elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, the researchers first taught individual animals to pull the rope with their trunks. The 12 elephants were then divided into six pairs, and each pair was released to walk to their waiting ropes. If one animal pulled the rope before the other, the rope would slip out, leaving the table—and treats—in place. “That taught them to pull together,” says Joshua Plotnik, a postdoc in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the lead author of the study, which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To find out if the elephants understood that they needed one another’s assistance, the researchers upped the challenge by releasing the elephants at different times. Thus, one elephant would arrive at the table before the other and would have to wait for a partner to show up before pulling the rope. “They learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” says Plotnik. “They would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting.” In another experiment, the partner’s rope was placed out of reach. “When the partner couldn’t do anything, the other one would just give up,” Plotnik says. That shows the elephants understood why the partner was needed, he adds.

“These are clever experiments,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who studies social cognition in wild elephants. The findings are consistent with observations in nature, she says. For instance, in East Africa biologists have seen elephants work together to lift a fallen companion with their tusks. “It’s particularly striking that the elephants were able to inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees do, comparative psychologist Nicola Clayton of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She and her team showed that rooks, too, could pass a similar dual-rope exam, although they failed to wait. The study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”

Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

Here is a unique multiple-choice item aligned to Common Core State Standard RI.8.2, designed for 8th-grade students based on the passage "James 'Jim' Bridger."

**Item ID:** RI.8.2-Bridger-002
**Standard:** RI.8.2 Determine a central idea of a text and analyze its development over the course of the text, including its relationship to supporting ideas; provide an objective summary of the text.

**Question:**
Which statement best analyzes how the author develops the central idea that Bridger’s deep knowledge of the wilderness contributed to the development of the American West?

A. By focusing on his blacksmithing apprenticeship to suggest that manufacturing skills were more valuable to settlers than survival skills.
B. By describing his tall tales to argue that his fame was based more on his personality than on his actual contributions to geography.
C. By connecting his years of experience exploring and trapping in the mountains to his later ability to guide settlers and identify key travel routes.*
D. By comparing his discoveries to those of Etienne Provost to imply that Bridger’s contributions have been largely overstated by historians.

**Rationales:**

*   **Option A is incorrect.** While the text mentions his apprenticeship in the first paragraph, it does not develop the idea that manufacturing skills were more valuable than survival skills. On the contrary, the text emphasizes that his "knowledge and skills" regarding terrain and wildlife (paragraph 7) made him a valued guide.
*   **Option B is incorrect.** The author includes the tall tales (paragraphs 5 and 6) to illustrate Bridger’s character and interaction with settlers. However, the text explicitly states in paragraph 7 that he was hired because he "learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife," not because of his stories. Therefore, the author does not argue that his fame was based *more* on personality than geography.
*   **Option C is correct.** The author develops the central idea by establishing a cause-and-effect relationship between Bridger's early life and his later contributions. The text first establishes his expertise gained through trapping and mapping (paragraphs 2-4 and 7), and then explains how that specific expertise allowed him to establish Fort Bridger and discover Bridger's Pass (paragraphs 5 and 8), directly aiding westward expansion.
*   **Option D is incorrect.** The mention of Etienne Provost (paragraph 3) serves as a supporting detail to clarify a historical fact about the Great Salt Lake. It functions as a correction of a specific detail rather than a method of developing the central idea. The rest of the text supports the validity of Bridger's other contributions, such as the Oregon Trail trading post and the railroad route.

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

## Multiple Choice Item for RI.8.2

**Question:** Which statement best describes how the central idea about Bridger's contributions to westward expansion develops throughout the passage and relates to the supporting ideas?

A. The passage introduces Bridger's early life and training, then demonstrates how each of his experiences built upon the previous ones to make him increasingly valuable to settlers moving west, with supporting details about specific discoveries and skills showing his growing expertise and influence.

B. The passage establishes Bridger as a natural explorer who made important discoveries, then narrows its focus to his role as a businessman at Fort Bridger, with supporting details about his storytelling and guiding work serving primarily to explain how he attracted customers to his trading post.

C. The passage presents Bridger's various accomplishments in chronological order without connecting them, using supporting details about his blacksmith training, beaver trapping, and storytelling to show the random variety of jobs available on the frontier.

D. The passage initially emphasizes Bridger's geographical discoveries as his main contribution, then shifts to argue that his storytelling was equally important, with supporting details about his trading post and guide work demonstrating how he balanced serious work with entertainment.

### Rationales:

**Option A (Correct Answer):** This option accurately captures the developmental structure of the passage. It begins with Bridger's youth and apprenticeship, then shows how his early exploration experience led to his trapping career, which led to establishing Fort Bridger, which positioned him to become a guide and discover Bridger's Pass. Each phase builds on the previous, showing his increasing value to westward expansion through specific supporting examples (Great Salt Lake discovery, beaver trapping expertise, Fort Bridger's strategic location, Bridger's Pass shortcut).

**Option B:** This distractor misrepresents how the central idea develops. While the passage does discuss Fort Bridger, it doesn't narrow its focus there—it continues to develop Bridger's contributions through his later work as a guide and his discovery of Bridger's Pass. It also incorrectly subordinates his guiding work as merely attracting customers rather than recognizing it as another significant contribution.

**Option C:** This distractor fails to recognize the clear developmental pattern and connections between Bridger's experiences. The passage deliberately shows how each experience prepared him for the next, not random frontier jobs. His blacksmith training, for instance, provided practical skills; his early exploration taught him the terrain that made him valuable as a trapper and guide.

**Option D:** This distractor creates a false equivalency between storytelling and geographical discoveries that the passage doesn't support. The passage treats storytelling as one interesting aspect of Bridger's character but doesn't argue it was as important as his geographical contributions. The text devotes much more space to his practical contributions to westward expansion than to his tall tales.

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

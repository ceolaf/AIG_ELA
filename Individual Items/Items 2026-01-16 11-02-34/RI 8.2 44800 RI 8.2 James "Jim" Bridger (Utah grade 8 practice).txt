Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

Here is a unique multiple-choice item developed for 8th Grade, aligned to CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RI.8.2.

**Item Draft**

**Stem:**
How does the author develop the central idea that Jim Bridger was instrumental in the settlement of the American West?

A. By highlighting his early apprenticeship as a blacksmith and his ability to make iron products.
B. By detailing how his knowledge of the terrain led to the establishment of key supply points and travel routes.*
C. By emphasizing that his entertaining tall tales were the main attraction for families deciding to move to Oregon.
D. By proving that he was the very first non-Native American explorer to locate the Great Salt Lake and Yellowstone National Park.

**Rationales:**

*   **A (Distractor):** This option is incorrect. While the text mentions Bridger’s background as a blacksmith in the first paragraph, this detail serves as background information regarding his practical skills. It does not develop the central idea regarding his influence on the broader settlement of the West.
*   **B (Key):** This option is correct. The text develops the central idea by describing how Bridger used his knowledge to build Fort Bridger (a supply stop on the Oregon Trail) and discover Bridger’s Pass (a shortcut used by settlers and the Union Pacific Railroad). These specific examples illustrate his instrumental role in facilitating western expansion.
*   **C (Distractor):** This option is incorrect. While the text discusses Bridger’s tall tales and notes that they amused settlers, it does not suggest the stories were the *reason* families moved West. This distractor relies on a misinterpretation of the relationship between the supporting idea (storytelling) and the central idea (role in settlement).
*   **D (Distractor):** This option is incorrect. While the text discusses his explorations of these areas, it explicitly states regarding the Great Salt Lake that "some now think that Etienne Provost... may have seen it first." Therefore, the text does not "prove" he was the first. Furthermore, mere discovery is less central to the theme of "settlement" than the infrastructure (Fort and Pass) mentioned in the correct key.

**LBIDAT Evaluation**

*   **Stem & Task (✓):** The stem aligns directly with RI.8.2 by asking the student to analyze *how* a central idea is developed. It requires synthesizing information from multiple paragraphs (specifically regarding Fort Bridger and Bridger's Pass) rather than recalling a single isolated fact.
*   **The Key (✓):** The key is definitively correct based on the text. Paragraphs 5, 7, and 8 explicitly link his skills and discoveries to the Oregon Trail, the Union Pacific Railroad, and the assistance of settlers.
*   **Distractors (✓):**
    *   Distractor A is a "Right There" detail that is irrelevant to the central idea (Scope error).
    *   Distractor C is a plausible misinterpretation of the cause-and-effect relationship between his personality and the settlers.
    *   Distractor D challenges the student's close reading of the text, which introduces doubt about Bridger's priority in discovery (Accuracy error).
*   **Stimulus (✓):** The stimulus provides sufficient evidence to answer the question without outside knowledge. The text is accessible and structured well for this analysis.
*   **Fairness (✓):** The topic is historical and biographical. There are no apparent sensitivity issues or emotional triggers that would prevent a student from demonstrating their knowledge.

================== Passage Text =================

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

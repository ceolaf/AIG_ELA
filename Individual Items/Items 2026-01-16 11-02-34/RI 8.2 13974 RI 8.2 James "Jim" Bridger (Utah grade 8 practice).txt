Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

## Multiple Choice Item

**How does the passage develop the central idea that Jim Bridger's frontier experiences made him increasingly valuable to America's westward expansion?**

A. The passage first describes Bridger's individual adventures as a young explorer, then explains how his business ventures created economic opportunities, and finally shows how his tall tales inspired others to move west.

B. The passage begins with Bridger learning practical skills, then details his accidental discoveries while working as a trapper, and concludes by showing how these random experiences unexpectedly helped some travelers.

C. *The passage starts by establishing Bridger's early exploration experiences, then demonstrates how his growing knowledge of the terrain led to successful businesses and guide work, and ultimately reveals how his discoveries created lasting infrastructure for westward movement.

D. The passage initially presents Bridger as one of many explorers, then distinguishes him through his storytelling abilities at Fort Bridger, and finally suggests his geographic discoveries were less important than his entertainment value.

### Rationales for Each Answer Option:

**Option A (Incorrect):** While the passage does mention Bridger's business ventures and storytelling, it doesn't present his tall tales as inspiring westward movement. The tales were for entertainment and teasing newcomers, not motivation. This option also misses the crucial point about his role as a guide and his discovery of important routes.

**Option B (Incorrect):** This option incorrectly characterizes Bridger's discoveries as "accidental" and his help to travelers as "unexpected." The passage shows deliberate exploration (he was chosen to explore the Bear River) and indicates his knowledge made him a "valued guide" whom people actively "hired," suggesting his assistance was intentional and sought-after.

**Option C (Correct):** This option accurately captures the progression of the central idea. The passage begins with Bridger's early explorations (Missouri River, Yellowstone, Great Salt Lake), then shows how this knowledge enabled him to establish Fort Bridger and become a sought-after guide, and culminates with his discovery of Bridger's Pass, which became part of the Transcontinental Railroad—permanent infrastructure that supported westward expansion. The supporting details about his trapping skills, storytelling, and twenty years as a guide all reinforce this trajectory.

**Option D (Incorrect):** This option diminishes Bridger's actual importance by suggesting he was just "one of many" initially and that his geographic discoveries were less important than his entertainment value. The passage actually emphasizes his pioneering role ("one of the first," "first non-Native American") and concludes by noting the many places named after him, indicating his geographic contributions were highly significant.

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

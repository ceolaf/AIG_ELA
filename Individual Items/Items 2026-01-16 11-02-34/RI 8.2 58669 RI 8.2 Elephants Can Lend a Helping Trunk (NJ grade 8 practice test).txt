Passage: RI 8.2 Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk (NJ grade 8 practice test).txt

1. Which choice best states a central idea of the passage and accurately explains how the author develops it?

A. A central idea is that elephants can be trained to perform complex tricks, which the author develops by describing how mahouts teach the elephants to pull the rope and respond to commands.  

B. A central idea is that elephants possess advanced social cooperation skills, which the author develops by explaining a series of rope‑pulling experiments and then citing scientists who connect these results to elephants’ behavior in the wild.*  

C. A central idea is that scientific experiments with animals have become more sophisticated over time, which the author develops by comparing the original 1930s chimpanzee study with the updated elephant version.  

D. A central idea is that many animals fail at cooperation tasks, which the author develops by focusing on how rooks and chimpanzees could not wait for partners in the rope‑pulling experiments.

---

Rationales:

A. Incorrect. While training is mentioned, it is a supporting detail used to set up the experiment, not the main focus. The passage centers on what the elephants’ behavior reveals about their social cognition, not on teaching them “tricks” or following commands.

B. Correct. The passage opens by stating that elephants understand when they need a partner and that this is a sign of higher social cognition. It then develops this idea by detailing the rope‑pulling tasks (simultaneous pulling, delayed release, and the out‑of‑reach rope) and finally by quoting experts who relate these findings to wild elephants lifting fallen companions and to broader evidence of elephants’ cognitive abilities.

C. Incorrect. The reference to the 1930s chimpanzee experiment is brief background, not a central idea. The author does not trace a history of animal experiments or show how methods have grown more sophisticated; instead, the focus is on what the elephant study reveals about cooperation.

D. Incorrect. The passage does mention that chimpanzees and rooks had difficulty waiting, but this is used to highlight how impressive the elephants’ performance is. The text does not mainly emphasize failure; it emphasizes elephants’ success and advanced cooperation skills.

Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk
by Virginia Morell 


Elephants know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk. That’s the conclusion of a new study that tested the cooperative skills of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand and showed that the pachyderms understand that they will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance. The ability to recognize that you sometimes need a little help from your friends is a sign of higher social cognition, psychologists say, and is rarely found in other species. Elephants now join an elite club of social cooperators: chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.

To test the elephants’ cooperation skills, a team of scientists modified a classic experiment first administered to chimpanzees in the 1930s, which requires two animals work together to earn a treat. If they don’t cooperate, neither gets the reward. For the elephants, the researchers used a sliding table with a single rope threaded around it. Two bowls of corn were attached to the table, but the elephants could reach them only by pulling two ends of the rope simultaneously. Working with mahout—Asian elephant trainers—trained elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, the researchers first taught individual animals to pull the rope with their trunks. The 12 elephants were then divided into six pairs, and each pair was released to walk to their waiting ropes. If one animal pulled the rope before the other, the rope would slip out, leaving the table—and treats—in place. “That taught them to pull together,” says Joshua Plotnik, a postdoc in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the lead author of the study, which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To find out if the elephants understood that they needed one another’s assistance, the researchers upped the challenge by releasing the elephants at different times. Thus, one elephant would arrive at the table before the other and would have to wait for a partner to show up before pulling the rope. “They learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” says Plotnik. “They would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting.” In another experiment, the partner’s rope was placed out of reach. “When the partner couldn’t do anything, the other one would just give up,” Plotnik says. That shows the elephants understood why the partner was needed, he adds.

“These are clever experiments,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who studies social cognition in wild elephants. The findings are consistent with observations in nature, she says. For instance, in East Africa biologists have seen elephants work together to lift a fallen companion with their tusks. “It’s particularly striking that the elephants were able to inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees do, comparative psychologist Nicola Clayton of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She and her team showed that rooks, too, could pass a similar dual-rope exam, although they failed to wait. The study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”

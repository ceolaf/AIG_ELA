**Item ID:** RL.8.4-001
**Grade Level:** 8
**Standard:** CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.8.4
**Passage:** Excerpt from *O Pioneers!*

**Item Stem:**

Read the sentence from the first paragraph.

“One January day, thirty years ago, the little town of Hanover, anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland, was trying not to be blown away.”

The word *anchored* usually denotes something held securely in place by a heavy weight. How does the author’s use of the word *anchored* in this specific context impact the meaning of the sentence?

A. It creates a tone of confidence by suggesting that the town has a long history of permanence and stability.
B. It emphasizes the town’s vulnerability, implying that it is engaged in a struggle to keep from being removed by the wind.*
C. It suggests that the town serves as a central trading port for the surrounding waterways and plains.
D. It indicates that the buildings in the town are physically weighed down by the heavy snows described in the paragraph.

**Rationales:**

**A. Incorrect.** This option relies on the positive, denotative definition of an anchor as something that provides stability and security. However, the context of the sentence (“trying not to be blown away”) and the subsequent description of the town (“None of them had any appearance of permanence”) contradict the idea that the town is confident, permanent, or stable.

**B. Correct.* ** This option correctly analyzes how the word functions within the specific context of the text. While an anchor is a tool for security, the author pairs it with the phrase “trying not to be blown away.” This creates a tension between the word and the context; it figuratively suggests that the town is not naturally part of the landscape but is instead a foreign object desperately holding on against the forces of nature. This word choice highlights the harshness of the setting and the fragility of the settlement.

**C. Incorrect.** This option relies on a literal association between the word “anchored” and ships or ports. A student choosing this option is focusing on the denotative definition of the word without recognizing the metaphorical usage required by the context (a “tableland” or prairie, not a body of water).

**D. Incorrect.** This option attempts to use context clues found later in the paragraph (“mist of fine snowflakes”) to explain the weight implied by the word “anchored.” However, the text states the town is anchored *on* the tableland, not weighted down *by* snow. The force acting upon the town in this sentence is the wind, not the snow.

Excerpt from O Pioneers!

by Willa Cather

One January day, thirty years ago, the little town of Hanover, anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland, was trying not to be blown away. A mist of fine snowflakes was curling and eddying about the cluster of low drab buildings huddled on the gray prairie, under a gray sky. The dwelling- houses were set about haphazard on the tough prairie sod; some of them looked as if they had been moved in overnight, and others as if they were straying off by themselves, headed straight for the open plain. None of them had any appearance of permanence, and the howling wind blew under them as well as over them. The main street was a deeply rutted road, now frozen hard, which ran from the squat red railway station and the grain “elevator” at the north end of the town to the lumber yard and the horse pond at the south end. On either side of this road straggled two uneven rows of wooden buildings; the general merchandise stores, the two banks, the drug store, the feed store, the saloon, the post- office. The board sidewalks were gray with trampled snow, but at two o’clock in the afternoon the shopkeepers, having come back from dinner, were keeping well behind their frosty windows. The children were all in school, and there was nobody abroad in the streets but a few rough- looking countrymen in coarse overcoats, with their long caps pulled down to their noses. Some of them had brought their wives to town, and now and then a red or a plaid shawl flashed out of one store into the shelter of another. At the hitch- bars along the street a few heavy work- horses, harnessed to farm wagons, shivered under their blankets. About the station everything was quiet, for there would not be another train in until night.

On the sidewalk in front of one of the stores sat a little Swede boy, crying bitterly. He was about five years old. His black cloth coat was much too big for him and made him look like a little old man. His shrunken brown flannel dress had been washed many times and left a long stretch of stocking between the hem of his skirt and the tops of his clumsy, copper- toed shoes. His cap was pulled down over his ears; his nose and his chubby cheeks were chapped and red with cold. He cried quietly, and the few people who hurried by did not notice him. He was afraid to stop any one, afraid to go into the store and ask for help, so he sat wringing his long sleeves and looking up a telegraph pole beside him, whimpering, “My kitten, oh, my kitten! Her will fweeze!” At the top of the pole crouched a shivering gray kitten, mewing faintly and clinging desperately to the wood with her claws. The boy had been left at the store while his sister went to the doctor’s office, and in her absence a dog had chased his kitten up the pole. The little creature had never been so high before, and she was too frightened to move. Her master was sunk in despair. He was a little country boy, and this village was to him a very strange and perplexing place, where people wore fine clothes and had hard hearts. He always felt shy and awkward here, and wanted to hide behind things for fear someone might laugh at him. Just now, he was too unhappy to care who laughed. At last he seemed to see a ray of hope: his sister was coming, and he got up and ran toward her in his heavy shoes.

His sister was a tall, strong girl, and she walked rapidly and resolutely, as if she knew exactly where she was going and what she was going to do next. She wore a man’s long ulster1 (not as if it were an affliction, but as if it were very comfortable and belonged to her; carried it like a young soldier), and a round plush cap, tied down with a thick veil. She had a serious, thoughtful face, and her clear, deep blue eyes were fixed intently on the distance, without seeming to see anything, as if she were in trouble. She did not notice the little boy until he pulled her by the coat. Then she stopped short and stooped down to wipe his wet face.

“Why, Emil! I told you to stay in the store and not to come out. What is the matter with you?”

“My kitten, sister, my kitten! A man put her out, and a dog chased her up there.” His forefinger, projecting from the sleeve of his coat, pointed up to the wretched little creature on the pole.

“Oh, Emil! Didn’t I tell you she’d get us into trouble of some kind, if you brought her? What made you tease me so? But there, I ought to have known better myself.” She went to the foot of the pole and held out her arms, crying, “Kitty, kitty, kitty,” but the kitten only mewed and faintly waved its tail. Alexandra turned away decidedly. “No, she won’t come down. Somebody will have to go up after her. I saw the Linstrums’ wagon in town. I’ll go and see if I can find Carl. Maybe he can do something. Only you must stop crying, or I won’t go a step. Where’s your comforter? Did you leave it in the store? Never mind. Hold still, till I put this on you.”

She unwound the brown veil from her head and tied it about his throat.

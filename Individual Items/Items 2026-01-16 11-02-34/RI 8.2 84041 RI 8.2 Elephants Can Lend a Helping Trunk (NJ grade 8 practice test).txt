Passage: RI 8.2 Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk (NJ grade 8 practice test).txt

Item (RI.8.2 – central idea and its development)

Which option best states a central idea of the passage and explains how the author develops that idea throughout the text?

A. The passage’s central idea is that elephants are motivated mainly by food, and the author develops this idea by repeatedly describing the corn bowls and showing how the elephants always pulled the rope to get their treats.  

B. The passage’s central idea is that elephants can understand when cooperation is necessary, and the author develops this idea by first presenting the claim, then describing increasingly challenging versions of the rope experiment, and finally adding expert opinions and real-world examples that confirm the findings.*  

C. The passage’s central idea is that rope-pulling experiments are the best way to study animal intelligence, and the author develops this idea by tracing the history of the experiment from the 1930s to the present and emphasizing how many species have taken part in it.  

D. The passage’s central idea is that elephant trainers (mahouts) are essential to research, and the author develops this idea by focusing on the mahouts’ role in teaching the elephants and highlighting their specialized skills.  


Key: B*


Rationales

A.  
- Misidentifies the central idea: food (corn bowls, treats) appears only as a reward in the experiment, not as the main focus of the passage.  
- The author does not “repeatedly” emphasize motivation by food; instead, she emphasizes what the elephants’ behavior reveals about their social cognition.  
- The development described (always pulling for treats) ignores key moments where elephants wait or give up, which are central to the idea of understanding cooperation.

B. *Correct*  
- Accurately states a central idea: elephants can recognize when cooperation is needed and adjust their behavior accordingly.  
- Correctly describes the development of this idea:
  - The introduction clearly states the claim that elephants “know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk” and links this to higher social cognition.  
  - The middle of the passage explains the basic rope experiment and then makes it harder (delayed release, out-of-reach rope) to show that elephants wait for a partner and stop when a partner can’t help—evidence that they understand the need for cooperation.  
  - The final paragraph adds expert commentary and wild-elephant observations (lifting a fallen companion) that support and extend the experimental results.  
- This answer captures both the central idea and how supporting ideas build and confirm it over the course of the text.

C.  
- Focuses on a tool (the rope-pulling experiment) rather than the main idea about elephants’ cooperative cognition.  
- The passage briefly mentions the experiment’s origin in the 1930s and its use with other species, but not to argue it is “the best way” to study intelligence.  
- The described development (history and number of species) misreads why these details are included—they serve to compare elephants to other animals, not to praise the experiment itself.

D.  
- Elevates a minor detail to a central idea: mahouts are mentioned only briefly as trainers who helped teach the elephants to pull the rope.  
- The author does not “focus” on mahouts’ skills or claim they are essential to research; the text centers on what the elephants do and what that behavior means.  
- The suggested pattern of development (emphasis on training and specialized skills) does not match the actual structure, which moves from experiment design to elephant performance to expert analysis.

Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk
by Virginia Morell 


Elephants know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk. That’s the conclusion of a new study that tested the cooperative skills of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand and showed that the pachyderms understand that they will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance. The ability to recognize that you sometimes need a little help from your friends is a sign of higher social cognition, psychologists say, and is rarely found in other species. Elephants now join an elite club of social cooperators: chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.

To test the elephants’ cooperation skills, a team of scientists modified a classic experiment first administered to chimpanzees in the 1930s, which requires two animals work together to earn a treat. If they don’t cooperate, neither gets the reward. For the elephants, the researchers used a sliding table with a single rope threaded around it. Two bowls of corn were attached to the table, but the elephants could reach them only by pulling two ends of the rope simultaneously. Working with mahout—Asian elephant trainers—trained elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, the researchers first taught individual animals to pull the rope with their trunks. The 12 elephants were then divided into six pairs, and each pair was released to walk to their waiting ropes. If one animal pulled the rope before the other, the rope would slip out, leaving the table—and treats—in place. “That taught them to pull together,” says Joshua Plotnik, a postdoc in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the lead author of the study, which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To find out if the elephants understood that they needed one another’s assistance, the researchers upped the challenge by releasing the elephants at different times. Thus, one elephant would arrive at the table before the other and would have to wait for a partner to show up before pulling the rope. “They learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” says Plotnik. “They would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting.” In another experiment, the partner’s rope was placed out of reach. “When the partner couldn’t do anything, the other one would just give up,” Plotnik says. That shows the elephants understood why the partner was needed, he adds.

“These are clever experiments,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who studies social cognition in wild elephants. The findings are consistent with observations in nature, she says. For instance, in East Africa biologists have seen elephants work together to lift a fallen companion with their tusks. “It’s particularly striking that the elephants were able to inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees do, comparative psychologist Nicola Clayton of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She and her team showed that rooks, too, could pass a similar dual-rope exam, although they failed to wait. The study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”

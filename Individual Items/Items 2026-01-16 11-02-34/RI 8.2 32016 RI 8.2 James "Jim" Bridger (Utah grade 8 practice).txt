Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

I'll develop a different multiple choice item aligned to RI.8.2 that focuses on a different central idea and its development throughout the text.

## Initial Item Draft:

**Stem:** Which statement best describes how the passage develops the central idea that Bridger's diverse skills made him valuable to westward expansion?

A. The passage first establishes Bridger's mechanical skills, then shows how he applied these same skills to wilderness survival, and concludes by explaining how he taught these skills to settlers.

B. The passage begins with Bridger learning practical trades, progresses through his discoveries and business ventures, and culminates with his contributions as a guide who helped others navigate the frontier.

C. The passage initially describes Bridger's natural talent for exploration, then explains how he refused to share his knowledge with others, keeping his discoveries secret for personal gain.

D. The passage starts by showing Bridger's failures as a blacksmith, then describes how he found success only after abandoning civilization for the wilderness.

## Answer Key and Rationales:

***B. The passage begins with Bridger learning practical trades, progresses through his discoveries and business ventures, and culminates with his contributions as a guide who helped others navigate the frontier.**

*Rationale for Correct Answer (B):* This option accurately traces how the passage develops the central idea of Bridger's diverse skillset. It starts with his blacksmith apprenticeship (paragraph 1), moves through his exploration achievements and discoveries (paragraphs 2-3), his success in trapping and establishing Fort Bridger (paragraphs 4-5), and concludes with his twenty years as a valued guide and the discovery of Bridger's Pass (paragraphs 7-8). Each phase builds upon previous skills, showing how his accumulated knowledge made him increasingly valuable to westward expansion.

*Rationale for Distractor A:* Students might select this if they overemphasize the blacksmith apprenticeship. However, the passage doesn't show Bridger applying mechanical skills to wilderness survival or teaching these specific skills to settlers. His value came from exploration and geographical knowledge, not mechanical expertise.

*Rationale for Distractor C:* This directly contradicts the passage. Bridger actively shared his knowledge by serving as a guide, entertaining settlers with stories at Fort Bridger, and his discoveries (like Bridger's Pass) were used by many travelers. The passage emphasizes his contributions to others, not secrecy.

*Rationale for Distractor D:* This misrepresents the passage's content. There's no indication Bridger failed as a blacksmith - he simply moved on to exploration at age eighteen. Additionally, he didn't abandon civilization but rather helped connect it to the frontier through Fort Bridger and his guide services.

## LBIDAT Evaluation:

**Stem & Task:** ✓ - The task appropriately asks students to analyze how a central idea develops throughout the text, directly addressing RI.8.2's requirement to trace development.

**The Key:** ✓ - The key is definitively correct and directly addresses how the central idea develops across the passage.

**Distractors:** ✓ - Each distractor represents a plausible but incorrect interpretation of how the passage develops its ideas.

**Stimulus:** ✓ - The passage is necessary to answer the question, and students must synthesize information from multiple paragraphs.

**Fairness:** ✓ - No sensitivity concerns present.

## Final Version:

**Which statement best describes how the passage develops the central idea that Bridger's diverse skills made him valuable to westward expansion?**

================== Passage Text =================

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

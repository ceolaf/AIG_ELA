Passage: RI 8.2 Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk (NJ grade 8 practice test).txt

Here is a high-quality multiple-choice item aligned to Common Core State Standard RI.8.2, designed for 8th-grade students.

**Item ID:** ELA-G8-RI.8.2-001
**Standard:** RI.8.2 (Determine a central idea of a text and analyze its development over the course of the text, including its relationship to supporting ideas...)
**Passage:** Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk

**Item Stem:**
Which statement best analyzes how the author develops the central idea that elephants possess high-level social cognition?

A. By comparing elephants to other species like hyenas and rooks to argue that elephants are the most dominant species in the animal kingdom.
B. By describing a study where elephants waited for a partner, using this evidence to clarify that their cooperation is based on understanding rather than just training.*
C. By relying on anecdotes from behavioral ecologists to prove that wild elephants are significantly more intelligent than the captive elephants used in the study.
D. By listing the specific steps of a rope-pulling task to demonstrate that elephants have the physical dexterity required to manipulate tools with their trunks.

**Rationales:**

*   **A is incorrect.** While the author mentions that elephants join an "elite club" of social cooperators alongside chimps, hyenas, and rooks (Paragraph 1), the text does not develop the idea that elephants are the "most dominant" species. The comparison is used to categorize their intelligence, not to rank their dominance.
*   **B is correct.** This option correctly traces the development of the central idea. The text introduces the concept of elephant cooperation (Paragraph 1), details the experiment (Paragraph 2), and then refines the central idea in Paragraph 3 by describing the "delayed release" test. This specific supporting detail (waiting for a partner) is crucial because it distinguishes simple training from actual "understanding" (cognition), which is the core of the central idea.
*   **C is incorrect.** The author uses quotes from experts like Karen McComb to *support* the findings of the study (Paragraph 4), but the text does not argue that wild elephants are *more* intelligent than captive ones. The expert commentary is used to validate that the study's results are consistent with nature, not to create a contrast between wild and captive intelligence.
*   **D is incorrect.** While the text describes the rope-pulling task and mentions the use of trunks (Paragraph 2), the central idea of the text is about *social cognition* (thinking/cooperating), not physical dexterity. This option focuses on a supporting detail regarding physical traits rather than the development of the primary theme of intelligence and cooperation.

Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk
by Virginia Morell 


Elephants know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk. That’s the conclusion of a new study that tested the cooperative skills of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand and showed that the pachyderms understand that they will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance. The ability to recognize that you sometimes need a little help from your friends is a sign of higher social cognition, psychologists say, and is rarely found in other species. Elephants now join an elite club of social cooperators: chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.

To test the elephants’ cooperation skills, a team of scientists modified a classic experiment first administered to chimpanzees in the 1930s, which requires two animals work together to earn a treat. If they don’t cooperate, neither gets the reward. For the elephants, the researchers used a sliding table with a single rope threaded around it. Two bowls of corn were attached to the table, but the elephants could reach them only by pulling two ends of the rope simultaneously. Working with mahout—Asian elephant trainers—trained elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, the researchers first taught individual animals to pull the rope with their trunks. The 12 elephants were then divided into six pairs, and each pair was released to walk to their waiting ropes. If one animal pulled the rope before the other, the rope would slip out, leaving the table—and treats—in place. “That taught them to pull together,” says Joshua Plotnik, a postdoc in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the lead author of the study, which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To find out if the elephants understood that they needed one another’s assistance, the researchers upped the challenge by releasing the elephants at different times. Thus, one elephant would arrive at the table before the other and would have to wait for a partner to show up before pulling the rope. “They learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” says Plotnik. “They would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting.” In another experiment, the partner’s rope was placed out of reach. “When the partner couldn’t do anything, the other one would just give up,” Plotnik says. That shows the elephants understood why the partner was needed, he adds.

“These are clever experiments,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who studies social cognition in wild elephants. The findings are consistent with observations in nature, she says. For instance, in East Africa biologists have seen elephants work together to lift a fallen companion with their tusks. “It’s particularly striking that the elephants were able to inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees do, comparative psychologist Nicola Clayton of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She and her team showed that rooks, too, could pass a similar dual-rope exam, although they failed to wait. The study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”

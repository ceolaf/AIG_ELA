Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

I'll create a different multiple choice item aligned to RI.8.2 that focuses on a different central idea and its development.

**Draft Item:**

**Stem:**
Which statement best describes how the passage develops the central idea that Bridger's diverse skills and experiences made him essential to America's westward expansion?

**Answer Options:**

A. The passage shows that Bridger was primarily important as an explorer who discovered new landmarks, with each discovery building on the previous one to open new territories.

B. The passage demonstrates that Bridger's main contribution was establishing Fort Bridger, which became the center of western trade and travel, supporting all other developments.

*C. The passage illustrates how Bridger's blacksmith training, early exploration experience, trapping expertise, storytelling ability, and geographical knowledge each contributed to different aspects of helping settlers move west, from maintaining their equipment to guiding their journeys.

D. The passage explains that Bridger started as an apprentice, became a successful businessman through beaver trapping, and retired wealthy after selling his fort to the government.

**Rationales:**

**Option A (Distractor):** This option overemphasizes exploration while missing how other skills (blacksmithing, storytelling, trapping) supported the central idea. Students choosing this tracked one thread but didn't synthesize how multiple supporting ideas developed the main theme.

**Option B (Distractor):** This incorrectly elevates Fort Bridger to the central idea rather than recognizing it as one supporting element. Students selecting this confused a significant detail with the overarching central idea about Bridger's multifaceted contributions.

**Option C (Key):** This correctly identifies how the passage develops its central idea by weaving together multiple supporting ideas—each skill and experience is shown to play a specific role in facilitating westward expansion. The blacksmith training helped with wagon repairs, exploration experience led to guide work, trapping expertise established his frontier presence, storytelling entertained and informed travelers, and geographical knowledge created shortcuts. This shows the relationship between supporting ideas and the central theme.

**Option D (Distractor):** This presents a chronological summary without analyzing how the central idea develops or how supporting ideas relate to it. Students choosing this may have identified sequence but not the deeper development of the central idea.

**LBIDAT Analysis:**

- **Stem & Task:** ✓ (Appropriately targets analyzing development of central idea and relationship to supporting ideas)
- **Key:** ✓ (Definitively correct and directly responsive)
- **Distractors:** ✓ (Each represents a plausible misunderstanding of central idea development)
- **Stimulus:** ✓ (Required for successful response)
- **Fairness:** ✓ (No sensitivity issues)

**Final Version:**

Which statement best describes how the passage develops the central idea that Bridger's diverse skills and experiences made him essential to America's westward expansion?

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

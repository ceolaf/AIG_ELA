Passage: RL 8.4 Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant (MN grade 8 2018).txt

Looking at this passage, I need to create a multiple choice item that tests students' understanding of how specific word choices impact meaning and tone, particularly focusing on figurative and connotative meanings.

Here's my item:

**In paragraph 4, the narrator says that Dr. Blackwell's approval "recedes in the distance" as she seeks it. What does this phrase suggest about the narrator's relationship with Dr. Blackwell?**

A. The narrator is physically moving away from Dr. Blackwell during their work together.

B. Dr. Blackwell is deliberately avoiding the narrator in the hospital.

C. *The harder the narrator tries to impress Dr. Blackwell, the more unattainable her approval seems to become.

D. Dr. Blackwell's eyesight is failing, making it difficult for her to see the narrator's work clearly.

**Rationales:**

**Option A (Incorrect):** A student selecting this option is interpreting the phrase too literally, focusing on physical distance rather than understanding it as a figurative expression. They miss that "recedes in the distance" is a metaphor for something becoming increasingly unattainable, not about actual physical movement.

**Option B (Incorrect):** This distractor shows a partial understanding that the phrase relates to separation between the two characters, but misinterprets it as Dr. Blackwell actively avoiding the narrator. The text shows Dr. Blackwell is actually very present and watchful, constantly observing and correcting the narrator's work.

**Option C (Correct):** This is the correct interpretation. The phrase "recedes in the distance" is used figuratively to convey that the more desperately the narrator seeks approval, the more elusive it becomes—like trying to reach something that keeps moving farther away. This metaphor effectively captures the narrator's frustration and the paradoxical nature of her situation.

**Option D (Incorrect):** This distractor represents an extremely literal misreading that confuses the metaphorical "distance" with a physical vision problem. A student choosing this has completely missed the figurative nature of the language and is trying to find a concrete, medical explanation in a passage about a medical setting.

This item effectively tests RL.8.4 because it requires students to recognize and interpret figurative language, understand how the author's word choice creates meaning beyond the literal, and analyze how this specific phrase contributes to the tone of frustration and inadequacy that characterizes the narrator's early experience with Dr. Blackwell.

Read this passage about a woman in the 1800s who works with a famous female doctor. Then answer the questions. Some questions may ask you about certain paragraphs. The paragraphs are numbered on the left side.

Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant

written for the Minnesota Department of Education

Elizabeth Blackwell was the first American woman to attend medical school. In 1857, unable to find work because of her gender, Dr. Blackwell opened her own clinic in New York, where her primary patients (and employees) were women. After the Civil War ended in 1865, she opened a medical school at the clinic to train other women to become doctors. The following is a fictional personal reflection written by a nurse who hopes to achieve this goal.

I was only a few days into my second week working under Miss . . . I mean, Dr. Blackwell, and already I felt that I could do nothing right.

Actually, my first mistake was not remembering to call her by her title. The idea of a woman doctor still required some adjustment, even though I harbored the hope of becoming one myself someday.

When I first heard of Elizabeth Blackwell and her accomplishments—the first American woman to be admitted to medical school, the first to become a doctor, the first to open her own clinic—she became my heroine. I saved as much money as I could from my nursing duties. When the war finally ended, I moved to New York and became one of her apprentices. My parents disapproved, of course; they thought I should return home and find a husband among the young men who survived the war. But after what I have seen and experienced at the battlefield, I know I can do more. I know that I am no longer satisfied with bandaging wounds and comforting the afflicted. I long to save lives, find cures for diseases, make the broken whole again. And now, someone has shown the world that women are as capable of accomplishing these deeds as any man.

However, my first week under Dr. Blackwell’s tutelage has, I fear, called my abilities into question. I was quite capable in my former role as a field nurse, but now I feel very self-conscious under her watchful eye. I either freeze like a statue or make all manner of clumsy blunders. If I was hoping to find a motherly figure in Dr. Blackwell, I was quickly disabused of that notion. On my very first day, when I failed to adequately prepare a tray of instruments, she thought nothing of reprimanding me in front of all the other students, nurses, and patients. Every day has brought at least one similar scolding. It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance.

I must somehow manage to do better, make no further mistakes, and gain the doctor’s respect, or she will send me away. That would extinguish my hopes, for the Women’s Medical College that Dr. Blackwell has founded here at the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children is the only institution of its kind.

This institution is sorely needed. Many women were made widows during the war. Others saw their husbands return to them so badly injured that they cannot possibly work. These women have little money for a doctor when they or their children become ill. Established doctors expect to be paid for their services. And so these less fortunate patients come to us.

I think the relief I see in these women’s faces, however, is based on more than financial concerns. Though the clinic accepts people who cannot pay, more than one young woman has communicated to me that she is more comfortable discussing her health problems with another woman than with a man. I am still not sure our patients are as confident in our abilities as they would be with those of a male doctor. Female physicians are still more of a curiosity than anything. These patients, however, cannot afford to doubt us.

Today I spoke soothingly to a nervous young woman who was in my charge, trying to calm her as I helped her onto the bed. The poor girl looked alarmed; her eyes darted back and forth, and her fingers trembled in my hands. She had obviously never been in a medical institution before.

 “Less chatter, please, Diana!” Dr. Blackwell snapped. “This is a hospital, not a place for idle conversation.” Once again, I felt unjustly reprimanded, like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar. As usual, I bit my tongue and said nothing. My patient forgot her fear for a moment and gave me a sympathetic look. That response only made me feel worse.

An industrial accident had occurred earlier in the day, so the night was unusually busy. I did not have the chance to stop and think but simply moved purposefully from one patient to the next, diagnosing problems and administering aid. Indeed, I was reminded of my time as a nurse on the battlefield during which rest was impossible to obtain.

Finally, the endless evening was finished. Only then did I turn to see Dr. Blackwell at my elbow. She had been assisting me all along, and I had not even acknowledged her. In fact, for the first time in almost two weeks, I had forgotten all about her. Now I was sure to be sent home.

But she was smiling at me.

“Well done, Diana!” she said. “Perhaps you will become a doctor after all.”

Passage: RL 8.4 Oh Pioneers (TN grade 8 Released 2023).txt

Here is a unique multiple-choice item aligned to Common Core State Standard RL.8.4, distinct from the previous item, and designed to score well on the LBIDAT criteria.

### Item Draft

**Standard:** RL.8.4 – Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text, including figurative and connotative meanings; analyze the impact of specific word choices on meaning and tone.

**Passage:** *O Pioneers!* (Excerpt)

**Item:**

Read the sentence from paragraph 1.

“The dwelling-houses were set about haphazard on the tough prairie sod; some of them looked as if they had been moved in overnight, and others as if they were **straying** off by themselves, headed straight for the open plain.”

How does the author’s use of the word **straying** affect the description of the town?

A. It highlights the rapid growth of the town as it expands onto the prairie.
B. It emphasizes the lack of planning and the isolation of the buildings.*
C. It suggests that the houses are temporary structures meant to be moved.
D. It creates a whimsical tone by comparing the houses to playful animals.

**Rationales:**

*   **A. Incorrect.** This distractor appeals to the phrase "headed straight for the open plain," which a student might interpret as a sign of progress or expansion. However, "straying" carries a connotation of wandering aimlessly or getting lost, rather than purposeful growth, contradicting the idea of successful expansion.
*   **B. Correct.** The word "straying" figuratively suggests wandering away from a group or path. In the context of the word "haphazard" and the "cluster" of buildings, this personification underscores the disorganization of the town and implies that the buildings feel disconnected from one another, reinforcing the bleak and unsettled nature of the setting.
*   **C. Incorrect.** This distractor confuses the figurative language with a literal detail. While the sentence mentions houses looking as if they were "moved in," the word "straying" describes their static arrangement relative to one another, not their physical portability.
*   **D. Incorrect.** This distractor correctly identifies the metaphorical link between "straying" and animals but misidentifies the tone. The passage describes a "gray," "drab," and "howling" environment; suggesting the tone is "whimsical" or "playful" is a clear misreading of the text's mood.

### LBIDAT Evaluation

**Stem & Task: ✓ (No Apparent Critical Issues)**
The stem focuses on the impact of a specific word choice ("straying") on the meaning of the description. It requires the student to analyze the figurative use of a word usually applied to animals or people, applied here to architecture, to understand the author's depiction of the setting. This aligns perfectly with the "advanced skill" of recognizing words in "unusual contexts" as defined in the prompt.

**The Key: ✓ (No Apparent Critical Issues)**
The key is definitively correct. The text explicitly describes the layout as "haphazard" (disorganized). The metaphor of houses "straying off by themselves" supports the interpretation of isolation and lack of planning.

**Distractors: ✓ (No Apparent Critical Issues)**
*   **Distractor A** is plausible if the student focuses on the directionality ("headed straight for") but misses the nuance of the target word ("straying").
*   **Distractor C** is plausible if the student conflates the "moved in overnight" description with the "straying" description, failing to distinguish the specific effect of the target word.
*   **Distractor D** checks for understanding of tone; it is plausible only if the student recognizes the personification but fails to connect it to the surrounding "drab" context.

**Stimulus: ✓ (No Apparent Critical Issues)**
The stimulus is appropriate, and the sentence is cited accurately. The item requires the stimulus to answer; one cannot define the effect of "straying" on *this* town without reading the specific description.

**Fairness: ✓ (No Apparent Critical Issues)**
The item focuses on architectural description and setting. It contains no sensitive topics or bias.

Excerpt from O Pioneers!

by Willa Cather

One January day, thirty years ago, the little town of Hanover, anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland, was trying not to be blown away. A mist of fine snowflakes was curling and eddying about the cluster of low drab buildings huddled on the gray prairie, under a gray sky. The dwelling- houses were set about haphazard on the tough prairie sod; some of them looked as if they had been moved in overnight, and others as if they were straying off by themselves, headed straight for the open plain. None of them had any appearance of permanence, and the howling wind blew under them as well as over them. The main street was a deeply rutted road, now frozen hard, which ran from the squat red railway station and the grain “elevator” at the north end of the town to the lumber yard and the horse pond at the south end. On either side of this road straggled two uneven rows of wooden buildings; the general merchandise stores, the two banks, the drug store, the feed store, the saloon, the post- office. The board sidewalks were gray with trampled snow, but at two o’clock in the afternoon the shopkeepers, having come back from dinner, were keeping well behind their frosty windows. The children were all in school, and there was nobody abroad in the streets but a few rough- looking countrymen in coarse overcoats, with their long caps pulled down to their noses. Some of them had brought their wives to town, and now and then a red or a plaid shawl flashed out of one store into the shelter of another. At the hitch- bars along the street a few heavy work- horses, harnessed to farm wagons, shivered under their blankets. About the station everything was quiet, for there would not be another train in until night.

On the sidewalk in front of one of the stores sat a little Swede boy, crying bitterly. He was about five years old. His black cloth coat was much too big for him and made him look like a little old man. His shrunken brown flannel dress had been washed many times and left a long stretch of stocking between the hem of his skirt and the tops of his clumsy, copper- toed shoes. His cap was pulled down over his ears; his nose and his chubby cheeks were chapped and red with cold. He cried quietly, and the few people who hurried by did not notice him. He was afraid to stop any one, afraid to go into the store and ask for help, so he sat wringing his long sleeves and looking up a telegraph pole beside him, whimpering, “My kitten, oh, my kitten! Her will fweeze!” At the top of the pole crouched a shivering gray kitten, mewing faintly and clinging desperately to the wood with her claws. The boy had been left at the store while his sister went to the doctor’s office, and in her absence a dog had chased his kitten up the pole. The little creature had never been so high before, and she was too frightened to move. Her master was sunk in despair. He was a little country boy, and this village was to him a very strange and perplexing place, where people wore fine clothes and had hard hearts. He always felt shy and awkward here, and wanted to hide behind things for fear someone might laugh at him. Just now, he was too unhappy to care who laughed. At last he seemed to see a ray of hope: his sister was coming, and he got up and ran toward her in his heavy shoes.

His sister was a tall, strong girl, and she walked rapidly and resolutely, as if she knew exactly where she was going and what she was going to do next. She wore a man’s long ulster1 (not as if it were an affliction, but as if it were very comfortable and belonged to her; carried it like a young soldier), and a round plush cap, tied down with a thick veil. She had a serious, thoughtful face, and her clear, deep blue eyes were fixed intently on the distance, without seeming to see anything, as if she were in trouble. She did not notice the little boy until he pulled her by the coat. Then she stopped short and stooped down to wipe his wet face.

“Why, Emil! I told you to stay in the store and not to come out. What is the matter with you?”

“My kitten, sister, my kitten! A man put her out, and a dog chased her up there.” His forefinger, projecting from the sleeve of his coat, pointed up to the wretched little creature on the pole.

“Oh, Emil! Didn’t I tell you she’d get us into trouble of some kind, if you brought her? What made you tease me so? But there, I ought to have known better myself.” She went to the foot of the pole and held out her arms, crying, “Kitty, kitty, kitty,” but the kitten only mewed and faintly waved its tail. Alexandra turned away decidedly. “No, she won’t come down. Somebody will have to go up after her. I saw the Linstrums’ wagon in town. I’ll go and see if I can find Carl. Maybe he can do something. Only you must stop crying, or I won’t go a step. Where’s your comforter? Did you leave it in the store? Never mind. Hold still, till I put this on you.”

She unwound the brown veil from her head and tied it about his throat.

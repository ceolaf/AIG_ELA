Passage: RL 8.4 Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant (MN grade 8 2018).txt

**Item Alignment:** Common Core State Standard RL.8.4
**Passage:** Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant

**Item:**

Read this sentence from paragraph 8.

“Female physicians are still more of a **curiosity** than anything.”

Based on the paragraph, what is the impact of the author’s use of the word **curiosity**?

A. It emphasizes that female doctors are seen as interesting novelties rather than trusted experts.*
B. It suggests that female doctors are eager to ask questions to understand their patients’ health.
C. It implies that patients are eager to learn from the female doctors because they are rare.
D. It highlights that female doctors are highly valued by the community for their unique skills.

**Rationales:**

*   **Option A is the correct answer.** This option correctly identifies the connotative meaning of "a curiosity" in this specific context. While "curiosity" often refers to a desire to learn, here it is used as a noun to describe an object or person that is strange, unusual, or a spectacle. The surrounding text contrasts this status with being "confident in our abilities," indicating that while the public finds the female doctors interesting to look at (a novelty), they do not yet view them with the seriousness or trust accorded to male doctors.
*   **Option B is incorrect.** This option confuses the noun phrase "a curiosity" (an object or person that is unusual) with the adjective "curious" (having a desire to learn). It incorrectly attributes the trait of inquisitiveness to the doctors, whereas the text describes how the doctors are *perceived* by others.
*   **Option C is incorrect.** This option misattributes the source of the "curiosity." It assumes the word implies the *patients* have a desire to learn from the doctors. However, the text indicates that patients come to the clinic due to financial need ("cannot afford to doubt us") and lack of other options, not because of an intellectual eagerness to learn from the rare female doctors.
*   **Option D is incorrect.** This option relies on a positive connotation of "curiosity" as something rare and therefore valuable (like an antique or a "curio"). However, the context of the paragraph ("I am still not sure our patients are as confident in our abilities") creates a tone of doubt and uncertainty, contradicting the idea that the community highly values their skills at this stage.

**LBIDAT Evaluation:**

*   **Stem & Task (✓):** The stem clearly directs the student to analyze the impact of a specific word choice within the context of the paragraph, aligning perfectly with RL.8.4. It requires understanding the specific, non-literal/nuanced usage of a known word ("curiosity" as a spectacle vs. an emotion).
*   **The Key (✓):** The key is definitively correct based on the textual evidence in paragraph 8, which explicitly contrasts the doctors being a "curiosity" with the patients' lack of "confidence" in them.
*   **Distractors (✓):** The distractors are plausible but definitively incorrect. They represent common errors such as confusing parts of speech/definitions (Option B), misattributing the feeling (Option C), or misinterpreting the tone/connotation (Option D). None are trick questions; all rely on a close reading of the text.
*   **Stimulus (✓):** The stimulus is a grade-appropriate literary passage that supports the item well.
*   **Fairness (✓):** The item and stimulus do not raise inappropriate sensitivity issues.

Dr. Blackwell’s New Assistant

written for the Minnesota Department of Education

Elizabeth Blackwell was the first American woman to attend medical school. In 1857, unable to find work because of her gender, Dr. Blackwell opened her own clinic in New York, where her primary patients (and employees) were women. After the Civil War ended in 1865, she opened a medical school at the clinic to train other women to become doctors. The following is a fictional personal reflection written by a nurse who hopes to achieve this goal.

I was only a few days into my second week working under Miss . . . I mean, Dr. Blackwell, and already I felt that I could do nothing right.

Actually, my first mistake was not remembering to call her by her title. The idea of a woman doctor still required some adjustment, even though I harbored the hope of becoming one myself someday.

When I first heard of Elizabeth Blackwell and her accomplishments—the first American woman to be admitted to medical school, the first to become a doctor, the first to open her own clinic—she became my heroine. I saved as much money as I could from my nursing duties. When the war finally ended, I moved to New York and became one of her apprentices. My parents disapproved, of course; they thought I should return home and find a husband among the young men who survived the war. But after what I have seen and experienced at the battlefield, I know I can do more. I know that I am no longer satisfied with bandaging wounds and comforting the afflicted. I long to save lives, find cures for diseases, make the broken whole again. And now, someone has shown the world that women are as capable of accomplishing these deeds as any man.

However, my first week under Dr. Blackwell’s tutelage has, I fear, called my abilities into question. I was quite capable in my former role as a field nurse, but now I feel very self-conscious under her watchful eye. I either freeze like a statue or make all manner of clumsy blunders. If I was hoping to find a motherly figure in Dr. Blackwell, I was quickly disabused of that notion. On my very first day, when I failed to adequately prepare a tray of instruments, she thought nothing of reprimanding me in front of all the other students, nurses, and patients. Every day has brought at least one similar scolding. It seems that the more I seek her approval, the farther it recedes in the distance.

I must somehow manage to do better, make no further mistakes, and gain the doctor’s respect, or she will send me away. That would extinguish my hopes, for the Women’s Medical College that Dr. Blackwell has founded here at the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children is the only institution of its kind.

This institution is sorely needed. Many women were made widows during the war. Others saw their husbands return to them so badly injured that they cannot possibly work. These women have little money for a doctor when they or their children become ill. Established doctors expect to be paid for their services. And so these less fortunate patients come to us.

I think the relief I see in these women’s faces, however, is based on more than financial concerns. Though the clinic accepts people who cannot pay, more than one young woman has communicated to me that she is more comfortable discussing her health problems with another woman than with a man. I am still not sure our patients are as confident in our abilities as they would be with those of a male doctor. Female physicians are still more of a curiosity than anything. These patients, however, cannot afford to doubt us.

Today I spoke soothingly to a nervous young woman who was in my charge, trying to calm her as I helped her onto the bed. The poor girl looked alarmed; her eyes darted back and forth, and her fingers trembled in my hands. She had obviously never been in a medical institution before.

 “Less chatter, please, Diana!” Dr. Blackwell snapped. “This is a hospital, not a place for idle conversation.” Once again, I felt unjustly reprimanded, like a child caught sneaking sweets from a jar. As usual, I bit my tongue and said nothing. My patient forgot her fear for a moment and gave me a sympathetic look. That response only made me feel worse.

An industrial accident had occurred earlier in the day, so the night was unusually busy. I did not have the chance to stop and think but simply moved purposefully from one patient to the next, diagnosing problems and administering aid. Indeed, I was reminded of my time as a nurse on the battlefield during which rest was impossible to obtain.

Finally, the endless evening was finished. Only then did I turn to see Dr. Blackwell at my elbow. She had been assisting me all along, and I had not even acknowledged her. In fact, for the first time in almost two weeks, I had forgotten all about her. Now I was sure to be sent home.

But she was smiling at me.

“Well done, Diana!” she said. “Perhaps you will become a doctor after all.”

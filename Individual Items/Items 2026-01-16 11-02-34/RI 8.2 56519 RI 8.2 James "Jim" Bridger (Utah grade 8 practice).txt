**Question:** Which statement best expresses the central idea of this passage?

## Rationales for Each Answer Option

**Option A (Incorrect):** Students selecting this option may have focused too narrowly on the Great Salt Lake discovery mentioned in paragraph 3. However, the passage actually states there is debate about whether Bridger was first to discover it, and this single achievement doesn't capture the full scope of Bridger's importance as presented throughout the entire text.

**Option B (Correct):** This is the best answer because it captures the comprehensive view of Bridger presented throughout the passage. The text develops this central idea by discussing his early exploration work (paragraphs 2-3), his success as a trapper (paragraph 4), his role at Fort Bridger and as a storyteller (paragraphs 5-6), his work as a guide and discovery of Bridger's Pass (paragraphs 7-8), and his lasting legacy (paragraph 9). All these elements support the idea that he was important to Western development in multiple ways.

**Option C (Incorrect):** While the passage does dedicate two paragraphs to Bridger's storytelling abilities, students choosing this option have overemphasized one supporting detail rather than identifying the broader central idea. The storytelling is presented as one aspect of his importance, not the main focus of the entire passage.

**Option D (Incorrect):** This option incorrectly establishes a cause-and-effect relationship that the passage doesn't support. While the text mentions his blacksmith apprenticeship, it doesn't suggest this experience was particularly important to his later achievements. Students selecting this may have misunderstood the chronological structure as indicating causation.

================== Passage Text =================

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

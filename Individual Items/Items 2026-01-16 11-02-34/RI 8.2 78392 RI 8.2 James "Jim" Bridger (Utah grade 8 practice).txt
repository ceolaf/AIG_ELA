Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

Here is a multiple-choice item aligned to Common Core State Standard RI.8.2, designed to test the analysis of central idea development.

**Item Stem:**
How does the author develop the central idea that Jim Bridger’s knowledge of the frontier was essential to the expansion of the American West?

A. By contrasting his accurate mapping of the Missouri River with his mistaken belief that the Great Salt Lake was part of the Pacific Ocean.
B. By explaining how the decline of the beaver trapping industry forced him to turn Fort Bridger into a trading post for travelers.
C. By describing his reputation for telling outrageous tall tales to tease new arrivals from the east and amuse local residents.
D. By showing how his years of trapping and exploring prepared him to establish a supply fort and locate a critical mountain pass for settlers.*

**Rationales:**

*   **Option A:** This option focuses on specific details regarding Bridger’s early explorations (the Missouri River and the Great Salt Lake). While these are facts included in the text, contrasting a success with a mistake does not effectively analyze the development of the central idea regarding his essential role in Western expansion. It focuses on isolated events rather than the relationship between his skills and the aid he provided to others.
*   **Option B:** This option focuses on a specific cause-and-effect relationship regarding his career change (from trapping to trading). While the text implies a transition, the central idea of the text is not an economic analysis of the trapping industry. This option misses the broader scope of how his knowledge served the expansion of the West through guiding and the railroad.
*   **Option C:** This option highlights a supporting idea—Bridger’s personality and storytelling. While this adds color to his biography and explains his fame, it is not the primary method used to develop the central idea of his *importance* to Western expansion. The tall tales are a facet of his character, but they do not explain his contribution to the infrastructure (the pass, the railroad, the fort) of the West.
*   **Option D (*):** This option correctly analyzes the development of the central idea. The text structures Bridger’s life by first establishing his skills (blacksmithing, mapping, trapping, learning the terrain) and then demonstrating how those specific skills were applied to help others (building Fort Bridger for supplies, using his knowledge to find Bridger’s Pass for the railroad). This option traces the progression from acquiring knowledge to applying it for the benefit of westward expansion.

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

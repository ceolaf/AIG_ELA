Passage: RI 8.2 James "Jim" Bridger (Utah grade 8 practice).txt

2. Which statement best analyzes how the passage develops a central idea about Jim Bridger’s importance in American history?

A. The passage presents Jim Bridger mainly as a comedian whose tall tales spread across the country, and it develops this idea by showing how his outrageous stories became more and more famous over time.  
B. The passage develops the idea that Jim Bridger’s lasting importance comes from his role in exploring and opening routes through the American West, showing this by moving from his early discoveries to his later work as a guide and the creation of paths like Bridger’s Pass that others continued to use.*  
C. The passage argues that Jim Bridger’s main historical contribution was building Fort Bridger, and it develops this idea by describing how every major traveler, railroad, and route in the West depended on that single location.  
D. The passage develops the idea that Jim Bridger’s life was mostly a failure, using examples such as his mistake about the Great Salt Lake and the fact that others may have discovered places before him to show that he had little real impact.

**Correct Answer: B***

### Rationales

**A. The passage presents Jim Bridger mainly as a comedian whose tall tales spread across the country, and it develops this idea by showing how his outrageous stories became more and more famous over time.**

- Why a student might choose it: They notice the vivid paragraph about his “funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable” stories and remember details such as “glass mountains” and “petrified birds.”  
- Why it is incorrect: Storytelling is **one supporting aspect** of Bridger’s life, not the central idea of the passage. Only a small section describes his tales, and the passage does not track how his stories “became more and more famous over time.” Most of the text focuses on exploration, guiding, and routes.

**B. The passage develops the idea that Jim Bridger’s lasting importance comes from his role in exploring and opening routes through the American West, showing this by moving from his early discoveries to his later work as a guide and the creation of paths like Bridger’s Pass that others continued to use.*  

- Why it is correct:  
  - Identifies a **central idea**: Bridger’s historical importance lies in his exploration and the travel routes and places he helped establish.  
  - Accurately describes **how the passage develops** that idea:
    - Early sections: his participation in mapping the Missouri River and being among the first non-Native Americans to see Yellowstone and the Great Salt Lake.  
    - Middle sections: his success as a trapper, part ownership of a trapping company, and the establishment of Fort Bridger on the Oregon Trail, where travelers stopped for supplies and repairs.  
    - Later sections: his deep knowledge of the Rocky Mountains, his work as a guide, and the discovery of Bridger’s Pass, which shortened trips and later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad in the Transcontinental Railroad.  
    - Conclusion: mentions that many western places are named for him, reinforcing his lasting impact.  
  - This option correctly links the **chronological structure** and supporting details (exploration, fort, pass, railroad) to the central idea of his enduring role in opening the West.

**C. The passage argues that Jim Bridger’s main historical contribution was building Fort Bridger, and it develops this idea by describing how every major traveler, railroad, and route in the West depended on that single location.**

- Why a student might choose it: Fort Bridger is clearly identified and described as important to people traveling the Oregon Trail, so it can seem central.  
- Why it is incorrect: Fort Bridger is an **important supporting example**, not the sole or main contribution. The passage does **not** claim that “every major traveler, railroad, and route” depended on it. It also emphasizes other contributions—Bridger’s explorations, guiding, and Bridger’s Pass leading to the Transcontinental Railroad—showing a broader central idea than just the fort.

---

**D. The passage develops the idea that Jim Bridger’s life was mostly a failure, using examples such as his mistake about the Great Salt Lake and the fact that others may have discovered places before him to show that he had little real impact.**

- Why a student might choose it: They focus on the detail that he misjudged the Great Salt Lake and that Etienne Provost may have seen it first.  
- Why it is incorrect: The passage treats those points as **minor corrections**, not as proof of failure. The overall tone and conclusion are positive: Bridger is remembered as a “skilled mountain man and storyteller,” and many places are named after him. The text repeatedly highlights his impact on exploration and transportation, which directly contradicts the idea that he “had little real impact.”

================== Passage Text =================

This passage explains the life and importance of an outgoing and talented nineteenth-century frontiersman.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

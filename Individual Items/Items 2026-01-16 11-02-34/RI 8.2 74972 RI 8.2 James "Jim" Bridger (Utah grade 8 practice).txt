### Rationales

**Correct Answer: C**

- The opening sentence states the passage will explain Bridger’s “life and importance,” signaling a focus on his contributions.  
- The text then moves in time order: youth and apprenticeship; early exploration (Missouri River, Yellowstone, Great Salt Lake); success as a trapper and business owner; creation of Fort Bridger; his role as a storyteller; his extensive knowledge of the Rockies; his work as a guide; his discovery of Bridger’s Pass and its later role in the Transcontinental Railroad; and finally his legacy in place names.  
- These details show his contributions increasing and lasting, so this option correctly identifies the central idea and how it is developed.

**Distractor A**

- The Great Salt Lake and the mention of Etienne Provost appear in a single paragraph.  
- The rest of the passage does not focus on his discoveries being questioned or corrected; instead, it continues to emphasize his skills, guiding work, and lasting honors.  
- This misidentifies a minor detail as the central idea and does not match the overall development of the text.

**Distractor B**

- The passage does describe Bridger’s tall tales and notes that he became famous for telling them, but it also gives substantial space to his real accomplishments: exploration, trapping, Fort Bridger, guiding, and Bridger’s Pass.  
- The text never states or implies that his stories were “more” important than his real achievements or that people valued entertainment over exploration.  
- This option exaggerates one supporting idea and incorrectly treats it as the main focus.

**Distractor D**

- While the setting is the nineteenth-century West, the passage does not emphasize danger or hardship (e.g., it does not describe injuries, disasters, or severe struggles).  
- Instead, it focuses on Bridger’s skills, achievements, and reputation.  
- This option misreads the purpose of the details about his travels and work, treating them as evidence of hardship instead of evidence of his growing importance.

James "Jim" Bridger
1804-1881 

James Felix "Jim" Bridger's life story is as interesting as the tall tales he used to tell. Bridger was born in Virginia in 1804. Later, his family moved to a farm near St. Louis, Missouri. At age fourteen, he went to work as a blacksmith's apprentice. He learned how to make horseshoes and other products out of iron. 

When Bridger was eighteen years old, he was the youngest member of a group that explored and mapped the Missouri River. As a part of the expedition, he was one of the first European American people to see the natural wonders of what is now Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone was the first in a long line of landscapes that Bridger was to encounter before others. While spending the winter of 1824-25 in what is now Cove, Utah, members of the team Bridger was with argued about which direction they thought the Bear River went. The team chose Bridger to explore the river. He ended up at the Great Salt Lake, which he mistook for an inlet of the Pacific Ocean because of the lake's saltiness. For many years, people assumed Bridger was the first non-Native American to discover the Great Salt Lake. However, some now think that Etienne Provost, a French-Canadian trapper, may have seen it first.

Using the skills he learned while exploring the Missouri, Bridger became very good at trapping beavers for their furs, also called "pelts." By 1830, Bridger became part owner of a company that specialized in beaver trapping. Beaver pelts were very popular for hats and clothing at the time.

Bridger's success at trapping-as well as the growing number of people moving to the western part of America-led to the building of a trading post and fort near the Green River in Wyoming. It became known as Fort Bridger. Many people passed the fort as they traveled west on the Oregon Trail. Often, the settlers stopped to buy supplies, get their wagons fixed, and hear Jim Bridger's stories. He became famous for telling tall tales to the people passing through.

Bridger's stories were funny, extravagant, and often unbelievable. He would tell stories of glass mountains, "petrified" birds singing "petrified" songs, and talk about days when Pike's Peak was just a hole in the ground. These outrageous stories were told both to tease new arrivals from the east and to amuse the locals who knew they weren't true.

The Rocky Mountains were largely unexplored and Bridger spent many years hiking them and trapping animals. In his travels, he learned a great deal about the terrain and wildlife of the area. Because of his knowledge and skills, he became a valued guide. People often hired him to lead them across the mountains.

In 1850, Bridger found a short cut through the mountains of Wyoming through the Rocky Mountains. This path became known as Bridger's Pass. Because the pass shortened trips by sixty-one miles, settlers moving west frequently used it. In addition, the pass later became part of the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific was part of the Transcontinental Railroad, the first railroad to cross America from coast to coast.

Bridger spent twenty years working as a guide. When he retired, he went back to Missouri to live on a farm, where he died in 1881 at the age of seventy-seven. Jim Bridger is remembered for being a skilled mountain man and storyteller. Today, there are many places in the American West named in honor of Jim Bridger.

Passage: RI 8.2 Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk (NJ grade 8 practice test).txt

Looking at this passage again, I need to create a different item that still tests students' ability to determine the central idea and analyze how it develops through its relationship to supporting ideas.

**Another way to approach this:** Focus on how the experimental evidence builds to support the central claim about elephants' cognitive abilities.

---

**Item:**

How does the text develop its central idea that elephants possess sophisticated cooperative intelligence?

A. The text establishes that elephants understand the need for cooperation by first describing a basic rope-pulling task that requires two elephants, then presenting variations that test whether elephants truly understand why a partner is necessary, and finally connecting these laboratory findings to observations of cooperative behavior in wild elephants.

B. The text proves elephants are the most cooperative animals by beginning with their placement in an "elite club," then showing how they outperform all other species in every experimental task, and ending with scientists declaring elephants superior to humans in social cognition.

C. The text demonstrates that Asian elephants are more intelligent than African elephants by starting with research in Thailand, then comparing different elephant populations' performance on cooperation tasks, and concluding with evidence that habitat influences cognitive development.

D. The text reveals that animal cooperation is instinctive rather than intelligent by first showing elephants completing tasks through trial and error, then demonstrating they simply copy other elephants' behaviors, and finally acknowledging that their actions are based on trained responses rather than understanding.

**Answer Key:** A*

**Rationales:**

**A (Key):** This accurately describes the text's structure: (1) paragraph 2 introduces the basic cooperative task requiring simultaneous rope-pulling, (2) paragraph 3 presents variations (delayed release, rope out of reach) that test whether elephants understand the necessity of cooperation rather than just performing a learned behavior, and (3) paragraph 4 connects the experimental findings to natural observations of elephants helping fallen companions, reinforcing the central idea.

**B:** This mischaracterizes both the central idea and its development. While the text mentions an "elite club," it doesn't claim elephants are "the most cooperative" or superior to humans. The text actually shows elephants joining other species as equals in this ability, not surpassing them in all tasks.

**C:** This introduces a comparison between Asian and African elephants that doesn't exist in the text. While the experiments used Asian elephants in Thailand and the text mentions observations of African elephants, there's no comparative analysis between the two populations' cognitive abilities.

**D:** This contradicts the text's central idea entirely. The passage specifically argues that elephants demonstrate understanding and higher cognition, not mere instinct or trained responses. The variations in the experiment (especially the "rope out of reach" test) were designed precisely to show that elephants understand why cooperation is needed.

**LBIDAT Evaluation:**

- **Stem & Task:** ✓ (Directly asks about central idea development, appropriate for RI.8.2)
- **Key:** ✓ (Definitively correct and directly responsive to the stem)
- **Distractors:** ✓ (Each based on plausible misreadings: B - exaggerating claims about superiority; C - inventing a comparison not in the text; D - reversing the text's argument about intelligence vs. instinct)
- **Stimulus:** ✓ (Passage required to answer correctly)
- **Fairness:** ✓ (No sensitivity issues)

Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk
by Virginia Morell 


Elephants know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk. That’s the conclusion of a new study that tested the cooperative skills of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand and showed that the pachyderms understand that they will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance. The ability to recognize that you sometimes need a little help from your friends is a sign of higher social cognition, psychologists say, and is rarely found in other species. Elephants now join an elite club of social cooperators: chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.

To test the elephants’ cooperation skills, a team of scientists modified a classic experiment first administered to chimpanzees in the 1930s, which requires two animals work together to earn a treat. If they don’t cooperate, neither gets the reward. For the elephants, the researchers used a sliding table with a single rope threaded around it. Two bowls of corn were attached to the table, but the elephants could reach them only by pulling two ends of the rope simultaneously. Working with mahout—Asian elephant trainers—trained elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, the researchers first taught individual animals to pull the rope with their trunks. The 12 elephants were then divided into six pairs, and each pair was released to walk to their waiting ropes. If one animal pulled the rope before the other, the rope would slip out, leaving the table—and treats—in place. “That taught them to pull together,” says Joshua Plotnik, a postdoc in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the lead author of the study, which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To find out if the elephants understood that they needed one another’s assistance, the researchers upped the challenge by releasing the elephants at different times. Thus, one elephant would arrive at the table before the other and would have to wait for a partner to show up before pulling the rope. “They learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” says Plotnik. “They would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting.” In another experiment, the partner’s rope was placed out of reach. “When the partner couldn’t do anything, the other one would just give up,” Plotnik says. That shows the elephants understood why the partner was needed, he adds.

“These are clever experiments,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who studies social cognition in wild elephants. The findings are consistent with observations in nature, she says. For instance, in East Africa biologists have seen elephants work together to lift a fallen companion with their tusks. “It’s particularly striking that the elephants were able to inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees do, comparative psychologist Nicola Clayton of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She and her team showed that rooks, too, could pass a similar dual-rope exam, although they failed to wait. The study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”

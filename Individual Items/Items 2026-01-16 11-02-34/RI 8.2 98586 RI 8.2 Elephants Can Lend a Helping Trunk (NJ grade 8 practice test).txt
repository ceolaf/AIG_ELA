Passage: RI 8.2 Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk (NJ grade 8 practice test).txt

Here is a multiple-choice item aligned to Common Core State Standard RI.8.2, designed for Grade 8.

**Standard:** RI.8.2: Determine a central idea of a text and analyze its development over the course of the text, including its relationship to supporting ideas; provide an objective summary of the text.

**Passage:** Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk

***

**Item:**

Which statement best analyzes how the author develops the central idea that elephants possess a high level of social cognition?

A. The author contrasts the physical strength of Asian elephants with that of chimpanzees to show that elephants are better suited for heavy-lifting tasks.
B. The author describes an experiment involving a rope and a sliding table to demonstrate that elephants can be trained to perform mechanical actions for food.
C. The author highlights the elephants’ ability to inhibit pulling the rope until a partner arrives to prove they understand the necessity of cooperation.*
D. The author lists various species that belong to an "elite club" of social cooperators to suggest that elephants are less intelligent than hyenas and rooks.

***

**Rationales:**

*   **A is incorrect.** While the text mentions both elephants and chimpanzees, the central idea is not about physical strength or heavy lifting. The comparison is made regarding their cognitive abilities (patience and cooperation), not their physical suitability for tasks.
*   **B is incorrect.** This option focuses on a supporting detail (the mechanics of the experiment) but misidentifies the central idea. The text is not arguing that elephants are simply "trainable" for mechanical actions; it argues that they possess "higher social cognition" and understand the *concept* of cooperation, which goes beyond simple rote training.
*   **C is correct (*).** This option correctly identifies the central idea (elephants possess social cognition/understand cooperation) and analyzes how it is developed through specific supporting evidence. The author details the phase of the experiment where elephants had to wait for a partner (Paragraph 3), using this specific behavior to distinguish true understanding from simple conditioning.
*   **D is incorrect.** The author mentions the "elite club" to elevate the status of elephant intelligence, not to suggest they are inferior to the other species listed. Furthermore, the text suggests elephants performed better than rooks regarding waiting, contradicting the idea that they are less intelligent.

Elephants Can Lend a Helping Trunk
by Virginia Morell 


Elephants know when they need a helping hand—or rather, trunk. That’s the conclusion of a new study that tested the cooperative skills of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand and showed that the pachyderms understand that they will fail at a task without a partner’s assistance. The ability to recognize that you sometimes need a little help from your friends is a sign of higher social cognition, psychologists say, and is rarely found in other species. Elephants now join an elite club of social cooperators: chimpanzees, hyenas, rooks, and humans.

To test the elephants’ cooperation skills, a team of scientists modified a classic experiment first administered to chimpanzees in the 1930s, which requires two animals work together to earn a treat. If they don’t cooperate, neither gets the reward. For the elephants, the researchers used a sliding table with a single rope threaded around it. Two bowls of corn were attached to the table, but the elephants could reach them only by pulling two ends of the rope simultaneously. Working with mahout—Asian elephant trainers—trained elephants at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, the researchers first taught individual animals to pull the rope with their trunks. The 12 elephants were then divided into six pairs, and each pair was released to walk to their waiting ropes. If one animal pulled the rope before the other, the rope would slip out, leaving the table—and treats—in place. “That taught them to pull together,” says Joshua Plotnik, a postdoc in experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and the lead author of the study, which appears online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To find out if the elephants understood that they needed one another’s assistance, the researchers upped the challenge by releasing the elephants at different times. Thus, one elephant would arrive at the table before the other and would have to wait for a partner to show up before pulling the rope. “They learned to do this faster than the chimpanzees,” says Plotnik. “They would stand there holding their end of the rope, just waiting.” In another experiment, the partner’s rope was placed out of reach. “When the partner couldn’t do anything, the other one would just give up,” Plotnik says. That shows the elephants understood why the partner was needed, he adds.

“These are clever experiments,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom who studies social cognition in wild elephants. The findings are consistent with observations in nature, she says. For instance, in East Africa biologists have seen elephants work together to lift a fallen companion with their tusks. “It’s particularly striking that the elephants were able to inhibit pulling” longer than chimpanzees do, comparative psychologist Nicola Clayton of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She and her team showed that rooks, too, could pass a similar dual-rope exam, although they failed to wait. The study “adds to the growing body of evidence that elephants show some impressive cognitive abilities.”
